<h1>Join the TradeTrust Readiness Programme – Apply today!&nbsp;</h1>
<p>The TradeTrust Readiness Programme, supported by the Infocomm Media Development
Authority (IMDA), invites Digital Trade Platforms (DTPs) and carriers within
the maritime trade ecosystem to adopt the TradeTrust framework and demonstrate live,
cross-platform interoperability for electronic Bills of Lading (eBLs).</p>
<p>Despite the growing potential of electronic Bills of Lading (eBLs), their
adoption has been hindered by key barriers, including interoperability
challenges between digital platforms, the imbalance of benefits between
DTPs and carriers, and limited scalability of existing solutions. These
challenges have left the industry with isolated systems and slow adoption,
preventing the seamless exchange of eBLs across platforms and across borders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through this programme, we aim to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Accelerate Industry Adoption: Bring together DTPs and carriers to integrate
TradeTrust, showcasing cross-platform interoperability and creating tangible
use cases for digital trade.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Catalyse eBL Solution Development: Support the development and pilot of
TradeTrust-enabled solutions that demonstrate title transfer interoperability,
legal compliance, and industry-standard adoption for eBLs.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The TradeTrust Readiness Programme, running from 4 February 2026 to 31
March 2027, will provide <strong>funding of S$80,000</strong> to support
8 DTP-Carrier pairs in their journey to digitalise and streamline trade
documentation. Applications are now open for those who wish to be part
of this transformative shift in global trade.&nbsp;</p>
