<p>The country guides for digital trade will equip you with the adoption
of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)
<a href="https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records</u> 
</a>(MLETR) by various jurisdictions and trade digitalisation initiatives
across the world.</p>
<p>TradeTrust provides legal validity for electronic negotiable documents
through compliance to MLETR requirements.</p>
<p>Instead of contractual rule book, your TradeTrust-issued electronic documents
will be supported by statutory law. When using TradeTrust-issued electronic
documents across MLETR-aligned and/or non-MLETR-aligned jurisdiction, it
is recommended to expressly choose a governing law and jurisdiction provision
for the documents with a MLETR jurisdiction like Singapore, New York, Delaware
and other <a href="https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records/status" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MLETR-compliant jurisdictions</a> including
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Bahrain, Papua New
Guinea, Belize, Kiribati, Paraguay, the Abu Dhabi Global Markets in the
United Arab Emirates. Your TradeTrust-issued electronic documents<strong> </strong>will
be functionally equivalent to their paper versions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Using an example of a shipment from a non MLETR-compliant jurisdiction
like China to Singapore, as long as the TradeTrust-issued electronic Bill
of Lading (eBL) by carrier is governed by a MLETR-compliant jurisdiction
such as Singapore, the eBL will be legally valid to facilitate the shipment.</p>

<h3><strong>Legal Considerations In The Use Of The TradeTrust Framework</strong></h3>
<p>Trade has relied on paper for hundreds of years despite legal, financial
and practical drawbacks and inefficiencies. Recent technological advances
and legal developments permit the use of electronic transferable documents
like electronic bills of lading in a decentralised manner that makes it
easier for adoption to scale organically.</p>
<p>The Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR), published by
the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) in
2017, aims to enable the legal use of electronic transferable records both
domestically and across borders. 8 jurisdictions, including Singapore have
adopted MLETR. United Kingdomâ€™s Electronic Trade Documents Act came into
effect on 20th September 2023.</p>
<p>TradeTrust, a framework and digital utility that enables trusted interoperability
of electronic trade documents across digital platforms, enables adopters
to easily implement ETRs like electronic Bills of Lading that comply with
the requirements as laid out in the MLETR and hence are legally valid across
multiple platforms and systems.</p>
