<p>The country guides for digital trade will equip you with the adoption
of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)
<a href="https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records</u> 
</a>(MLETR) by various jurisdictions and trade digitalisation initiatives
across the world.</p>
<p>TradeTrust provides legal validity for electronic negotiable documents
through compliance to MLETR requirements.</p>
<p>Instead of contractual rule book, <strong>your TradeTrust-issued electronic documents will be supported by statutory law. </strong>They
will be functionally equivalent to their paper versions if the governing
law is under one of the statutory laws: Singapore, New York, Delaware and
other <a href="https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records/status" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MLETR-compliant jurisdictions</a> including
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Bahrain, Papua New
Guinea, Belize, Kiribati, Paraguay, the Abu Dhabi Global Markets in the
United Arab Emirates</p>
