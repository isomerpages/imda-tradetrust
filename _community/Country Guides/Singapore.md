<h2><strong>Electronic Transactions Act (ETA)</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<h4>What is Singapore's ETA?</h4>
<p>The Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) was first enacted in July 1998 in
Singapore to provide a legal foundation for electronic transactions, and
to give predictability and certainty to contracts formed electronically.
It does not mandate the use of electronic signatures or transactions and
facilitates their use where parties choose to transact electronically.</p>
<p>As such, paper documents still remain as the prevailing medium.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>2021 Amendment</h4>
<p>To ensure that Singaporeâ€™s legal and regulatory infrastructure keeps pace
with international trade law and the latest technological advancements,
the Ministry of Communications &amp; Information (MCI) and the Infocomm
Media Development Authority (IMDA) amended the ETA in March 2021, to adopt
the <a href="https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records</a> (MLETR)
published by United Nations Commission on International Trade Law with
modifications into Singapore law, and for the ETA to apply to transferable
documents or instruments such as Bills of Lading. The MLETR aims to enable
the legal use of electronic transferable records both domestically and
across borders.</p>
<p><strong>This enables you to the creation and use of Electronic Transferable Records (ETRs) or transferable documents such as electronic bills of lading (eBLs), which are key documents for international trade. </strong>Previously,
usage of electronic versions of BLs had been difficult due to technological
and legal challenges in establishing what is the "original document" and
"who possesses it".</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Benefits to Trade</h4>
<p>The Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) facilitates the use of e-commerce
and e-transactions by giving e-contracts and e-signatures the same status
as written contracts and signatures.</p>
<p><strong>Your TradeTrust-issued electronic documents will be functionally equivalent to their paper versions if the governing law is under one of the statutory law: Singapore, New York, Delaware and other <a href="https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records/status" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MLETR-compliant jurisdictions</a> including United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Bahrain, Papua New Guinea, Belize, Kiribati, Paraguay, the Abu Dhabi Global Markets in the United Arab Emirates.</strong>
</p>
<p>Having your documents and instruments available in electronic form can
greatly benefit you by improving the speed and security of your transactions,
allowing you to reuse data, and automating certain transactions. This makes
trading more efficient and convenient for you.</p>
