<p>The promise of industry-wide adoption of electronic Bills of Lading (eBLs)
has been hampered by a fragmented, siloed landscape of proprietary platforms.
Despite decades of trials, <strong>eBL uptake remains dismal – <a href="https://dcsa.org/newsroom/dcsas-member-carriers-commit-to-a-fully-standardised-electronic-bill-of-lading-by-2030" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">45 million</a> bills of lading are issued by ocean carriers yearly and only around <a href="https://www.gtreview.com/news/digital-trade/ebl-adoption-doubles-to-5-but-barriers-to-digitisation-remain-dcsa-finds/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">5%</a> were electronic</strong>.
A major culprit is a lack of widespread <strong>interoperability of the systems that manage the eBLs</strong>.</p>
<p>Today’s eBL world is dominated by closed systems. Each platform requires
all parties – shippers, carriers, banks, consignees – to be onboarded under
its own rules and onto its own platform. If a counterparty isn’t on <em>the same</em> platform,
digital trade often grinds to a halt, reverting to paper or costly workarounds.
No wonder eBL adoption has stalled: the network effect is broken when every
platform is a walled garden.</p>
<p>Senior executives across shipping lines, digital trade platforms, and
policymakers are rightly asking: <strong>How can we work across these silos?</strong> How
can we enable an eBL issued on one system to be accepted on another, legally
and securely, without needing everyone involved in the trade transaction
to be on a single platform? The answer lies in embracing <strong>interoperability</strong> as
a first principle. In this piece, we’ll examine the current interoperability
efforts – from industry standards to bilateral integrations – and explain
why <strong>TradeTrust, an open-source and neutral framework, offers the most feasible and scalable solution</strong> to
connect the digital trade ecosystem. TradeTrust can <strong>unlock cross-platform interoperability through portable documents </strong>by <em>complementing</em> existing
platforms (not competing with them), ultimately accelerating global trade
digitalisation.</p>

</p>
<h3><strong>The siloed landscape: Why eBL adoption has stalled</strong></h3>
<p>It’s no secret that eBL adoption has been sluggish.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://fiata.org/n/fit-alliances-2024-ebl-survey-shows-steady-rise-of-electronic-bill-of-lading-adoption-globally-collaboration-across-trade-supply-chain-could-unlock-further-gains/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">FIT Alliance</a>’s
2024 survey, 71% of respondents identified technological and platform interoperability
concerns as a key barrier to eBL adoption. Earlier analysis also described
eBL platforms as ‘walled gardens’, meaning all participants must use the
same platform to transact, highlighting the need for interoperable solutions.
Approximately ten years ago, when the International Group of P&amp;I Clubs
began approving these legal rulebooks for eBL systems, <strong>each platform became a closed ecosystem</strong>.
An eBL issued on Platform A could not simply “handover” to Platform B in
mid-transaction – there was no common legal agreement or technical channel
to allow that. Without interoperability, eBLs cannot move between platforms
in real time as parties are bound by different contracts, forcing everyone
onto one platform or back to paper.</p>
<p>The result?</p>
<p>A shipper on Platform X cannot endorse an eBL to a bank on Platform Y,
or a carrier using Platform A cannot surrender the eBL to a consignee on
Platform B – unless one party abandons their platform and joins the other’s.
This forces parties to join multiple platforms, adding usage fees, system
management complexity, and the burden of tracking multiple login credentials.
These legal and technical roadblocks have made eBL usage <strong>fragmented and rare</strong>,
despite the technology being available.</p>
<p>An industry survey by <a href="https://www.fit-alliance.org/post/fit-alliance-ebl-report" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">FIT Alliance</a> found
that while awareness of eBLs is high, only 21% of responding banks currently <em>accept</em> eBLs
– citing lack of interoperability as a key cause of hesitancy. In other
words, everyone is waiting on everyone else, stuck in separate digital
camps. The <strong>absence of a common highway</strong> between these camps
has kept digital Bills of Lading from reaching critical mass.</p>
<h3><strong>Interoperability efforts: DCSA, DNI Initiative, and Platform Partnerships</strong></h3>
<p>The industry recognises interoperability as the “missing link” to scale
eBL adoption. Several models have emerged to bridge the gap:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>DCSA’s standards-based approach</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Digital Container Shipping Association (DCSA), backed by major carriers,
has led a collaborative push for eBL platform interoperability. <a href="https://dcsa.org/newsroom/ebl-interoperability-milestone" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">DCSA</a>’s
framework defines a standardised API called <strong>PINT</strong> for bilateral
platform integration, a <strong>Multilateral Service Provider Interoperability Agreement</strong> (legal
rulebook between platform providers), and a <strong>Control Tracking Registry</strong> to
track which platform holds a given eBL at any time.</p>
<p>In March 2025, this group achieved the first proof-of-concept of a <strong><a href="https://www.iqax.com/en/about/newsroom/2025/01/breaking-down-silos-iqax-ebl-interoperability-approved-by-ig-pi-clubs/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">standards-based eBL transfer between platforms</a></strong>,
with all four key pillars addressed – technical connectivity, legal terms,
liability allocation, and the International Group of Protection and Indemnity
(IG P&amp;I) Clubs insurance approval. Recently, the IG P&amp;I Clubs approved
new interoperability clauses developed via DCSA’s efforts, which eBL providers
like <a href="https://web.edoxonline.com/index.php/2025/05/19/edoxonline-leads-the-first-live-interoperability-ebl-transaction/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">edoxOnline</a> and
IQAX have added to their terms.</p>
<p>This allows eBLs to move between <em>IG-approved</em> systems if certain
conditions (like using a legally-recognised electronic trade law) are met.
DCSA’s model is a big step forward, standardising how platforms can “talk”
to each other.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>ITFA’s digital negotiable instruments (DNI) Initiative</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In trade finance, the International Trade &amp; Forfaiting Association
(<a href="https://itfa.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ITFA</a>)
has been actively advancing the digitisation of negotiable instruments
via its <strong><a href="https://itfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-ITFA-DNI-Addendum-final_v3.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Negotiable Instruments</a> (DNI) Initiative</strong>.
The focus here is on fully digitising promissory notes and bills of exchange
– instruments akin to eBLs in that they require exclusive control and transfer.</p>
<p>The DNI blueprint combines <strong>advanced document technology, electronic signatures, and distributed ledger technology (DLT) (blockchain)</strong> with
appropriate legal frameworks. Notably, ITFA helped lobby for reforms like
the UK Electronic Trade Documents Act 2023 to legalise digital negotiable
instruments. While DNI is geared towards trade finance instruments (e.g.
digital promissory notes or electronic bill of exchange (eBoE)), its principles
of <strong>techno-legal interoperability and document portability</strong> parallel
what’s needed for eBLs. In fact, solutions emerging from the DNI initiative
(such as Enigio’s <em>Trace:Original</em> for digital original documents)
can complement eBL platforms by enabling documents to <strong>move outside a single platform environment</strong>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Bilateral platform integrations</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Several eBL providers have taken matters into their own hands by forging
direct integrations or interoperability pilots with each other.</p>
<p>A prime example came in March 2025, when carrier Orient Overseas Container
Line (OOCL) (on the <strong><a href="https://www.iqax.com/en/about/newsroom/2025/03/cross-platform-ebls-become-a-reality-as-oocl-and-a-major-oil-and-gas-company-go-live/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">IQAX</a></strong> eBL
platform) successfully transferred an eBL to a major oil &amp; gas customer
on the <strong>ICE CargoDocs</strong> platform, using the Global Shipping
Business Network (GSBN) blockchain as a secure registry. This cross-platform
eBL transaction – governed by UK law (under the UK Electronic Trade Documents
Act) – was enabled by a <em>joint liability agreement</em> between the platforms
and a shared blockchain record to ensure only one original exists. It was <em>the first of its kind</em> in
container shipping, and OOCL’s managing director hailed it as an innovation
that improves customer service and a “more efficient and secure global
trade ecosystem”.</p>
<p>Likewise, platforms Enigio (a fintech solution for digital original documents)
and TradeGo (a China-based eBL platform) recently integrated their systems
to allow a <strong>Europe-to-China shipment to be completed entirely with e-documents</strong>,
transferring an eBL from <a href="https://www.gtreview.com/news/digital-trade/enigio-tradego-declare-digital-silk-road-open-after-europe-china-transaction/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Sweden to China</a> under
English law, demonstrating interoperability to drive digital trade.</p>
<p>These pilot projects prove that <strong>when two platforms collaborate, they can technically and legally bridge their eBLs</strong> –
albeit with custom agreements or one-off integrations in each case.</p>
<p>Each of these efforts – standardisation via DCSA, trade finance initiatives
via ITFA, and bilateral partnerships – brings the industry closer to a
world where eBLs can move as freely as paper. They address the problem
from slightly different angles but share the same goal: making eBLs <strong>more universally transferable.</strong> However,
many of these approaches still require complex coordination, proprietary
agreements, or central registries. What’s needed is a <strong>truly open, neutral “highway” for eBLs</strong> that
any platform or company can use, without negotiating bespoke deals each
time. This is where <strong>TradeTrust</strong> comes in.</p>
<p><strong>In the next part, we’ll dive into how TradeTrust creates the open highway for global trade interoperability.</strong>
