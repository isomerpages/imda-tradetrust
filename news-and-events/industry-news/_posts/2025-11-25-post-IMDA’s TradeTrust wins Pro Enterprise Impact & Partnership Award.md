<p>Through the PEP-SBF Awards, Singapore champions deeper public-private
collaboration to streamline regulations and encourage innovative approaches
that drive strong business growth. This recognition affirms TradeTrust’s
role in advancing more business-friendly regulatory environments through
impactful, cross-sector partnerships while underscoring IMDA’s ongoing
commitment to fostering innovation-friendly partnerships that drive efficiency,
transparency, and growth in global trade.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The World’s First Interoperable Digital D/P Trial</h4>
<p>TradeTrust is a framework that standardises digital trade with enhanced
security and legal certainty for the international trade ecosystem. It
allows trading partners to create, exchange, and verify digitised documents
and transfer ownership seamlessly across different digital platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This framework enabled the world’s first interoperable Digital (D/P) trial,
jointly completed by the Beijing Two-Zone Office and Singapore’s Infocomm
Media Development Authority (IMDA) on 9 April 2025. The trial, involving
a live transaction between COFCO Industrial Food from Xiamen Port to Singapore’s
Yit Hong Pte Ltd, allowed for paperless trade between digital trade infrastructures
(specifically between Singapore’s SGTraDex and China’s AEOTrade), creating
seamless cross-border transactions in the shipping and logistics sectors.&nbsp;</p>

Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, DBS, and UOB, who played a crucial

world-class digital trade hub.&nbsp;</p>
