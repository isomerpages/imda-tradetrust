<p>TradeTrust is proud to be featured in <em><a href="https://iccwbo.uk/next-generation-trade-corridors/" class="Hyperlink SCXW201137447 BCX0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>Next-generation Trade Corridors: Building Digital Trade Superhighways</u></a></em>,
a report by <a href="https://iccwbo.uk/" class="Hyperlink SCXW201137447 BCX0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) United Kingdom</u></a>.
Featured as a case study, the report details TradeTrust’s successful execution
of the world’s first interoperable <a href="https://www.tradetrust.io/beijing-and-singapore-launch-interoperable-digital-documents-against-payment-trade-corporation/https:/www.tradetrust.io/beijing-and-singapore-launch-interoperable-digital-documents-against-payment-trade-corporation/" class="Hyperlink SCXW201137447 BCX0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>Digital Documents against Payment (D/P) trial</u></a>,
jointly completed by the Beijing Two-Zone Office and Singapore’s Infocomm
Media Development Authority (IMDA) on 9 April 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ICC UK is the representative voice of the ICC in the UK, and a leading
voice in global trade rules and standards. The report identifies how connecting
key trade finance and logistics hubs such as China, Singapore, and the
US, can unlock faster, cheaper and more sustainable trade. Using real-world
case studies, the report also outlines practical steps to modernise trade
corridors, build interoperable digital systems, and move away from paper-based
processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are honoured to be recognised by a world-renowned organisation which
reinforces TradeTrust’s standing as a trusted, interoperable and legally
compliant framework driving the future of global trade.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>A Milestone Project</h3>
<p>The case study featured in the article involved a live transaction between
COFCO Industrial Food and Yit Hong Pte Ltd, the first interoperable digital
D/P for live trade involving major exporters, importers, banks, and carriers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>COFCO Industrial Food shipped canned food from Xiamen Port to Singapore’s
Yit Hong Pte Ltd, with Pacific International Lines (PIL) as the carrier.
The deal was supported by Bank of China and ICBC (remitting banks) alongside
DBS and UOB (collecting banks), utilising TradeTrust-enabled electronic
Bills of Lading (eBL).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project also achieved cross-chain interoperability across blockchains
(ChainMaker and ASTRON) and platforms (AEOTrade and SGTraDex), proving
how trusted digital documents can flow securely across different systems
within the TradeTrust framework.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Trial: A Glimpse into the Future of Trade&nbsp;</h3>
<h4><em>Reduced costs</em>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The trial’s success underscored the transformative benefits of paperless
trade. By replacing traditional cross-border paper document mailing with
digital transmission, bank document circulation costs were reduced by 30%.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>Faster processing times</em>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Transaction cycles were also significantly shortened. COFCO Industrial
Food noted a 75% time save, with the time taken from shipment to payment
settlement reduced from 20 days to five days. Similarly, Yit Hong Pte Ltd
cut documentation handling time by 60%, while PIL reduced the processing
time for Bills of Lading by 99%, from 5 to 10 days to only 8 minutes per
transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>More streamlined workflows</em>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>A key feature of TradeTrust-enabled eBLs is the seamless transfer across
TradeTrust-ready platforms, giving trading partners the flexibility to
use their preferred systems, such as AEOTrade and SGTraDex. ASTRON’s blockchain
technology supported this trial to enhance security and mitigate risks
such as document fraud, loss, or tampering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report highlights that this decentralised approach means parties no
longer need to operate on a common digital platform or adhere to one contractual
rulebook, allowing each party to operate autonomously while maintaining
legal integrity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the trial showed the real-world benefits of digitalising current
workflows and demonstrated TradeTrust’s ability to address longstanding
inefficiencies in traditional trade processes.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What this Means for the World&nbsp;</h3>
<p>By eliminating the need for paper and courier transport, leading to a
reduction of carbon footprint, the trial fosters more efficient, sustainable
and climate-conscious global trade practices. It showcases a model for
scaling digital trade adoption globally, aligned with UN Sustainable Development
Goals and following internationally recognised standards like The United
Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT),
W3C, and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)
Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR).&nbsp;</p>
<p>TradeTrust’s feature in <em>Next-generation Trade Corridors: Building Digital Trade Superhighways </em>emphasises
the benefits gained from the trial and highlights our role in shaping the
future of global trade by streamlining workflows and enhancing trade security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TradeTrust will continue to explore broader end-to-end interoperable digital
trade scenarios, contributing to broader global adoption of interoperable
digital trade solutions.&nbsp;</p>
