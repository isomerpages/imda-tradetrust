<p>UN/CEFACT White Paper on Transfer of Model Law on Electronic Transferable
Records - Compliant Titles.</p>
<p>This White Paper explains the key requirements laid out in the MLETR that
an electronic record must satisfy to be an ETR so that its legal validity
is preserved even when used across international borders through achieving
the same legal effects as are achieved by use of its paper counterpart.
These are the requirements of writing and signature, integrity, singularity,
exclusive control to preclude double-spending, delivery and endorsement.
The MLETR also provides for changes of medium where required.</p>

designed to support implementers with detailed technical information:</p>

which is an open framework adapted for global trade practices to help the
typically long chain of business partners achieve the ultimate objective
of fully digitalising their business processes even across borders through
being able to cater for both normal documents and transferable documents
like Bills of Lading. Given the complexities of cross-border trade, success
requires a multi-prong and holistic approach. The technology underpinnings
of
<mark>TradeTrust</mark>are provided by OpenAttestation (see <a href="https://www.openattestation.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.openattestation.com</a>)
to enable documents issued with this technology to be cryptographically
trustworthy and able to be verified independently, as well as being able
to effect title transfers through ETRs. OpenAttestation has been registered
as a Digital Public Good with the Digital Public Goods Alliance (see
<a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://digitalpublicgoods.net</a>). Atop this <strong>freely-available</strong>, <strong>open-source </strong>technology,
<mark>TradeTrust</mark>adds aspects such as acceptance by the global trade community
and governments on the methods of document digitalisation as well as alignment
on policy stances through Government-level arrangements such as Digital
Economy Agreements. These efforts have resulted in the following features
being implemented:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Title Transfer feature supports electronic transferable records and
is designed to be compliant to the requirements laid out in the UNCITRAL
Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (2017).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Decentralised document rendering protocol enables users to choose
their own document schema format, and to customise the look and feel of
the trade documents produced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selective Redaction provides a convenient method for intermediaries in
the supply chain to hide sensitive data, which is critical for some use
cases in the trade and traceability domains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The QR Code feature enables users to choose using paper or digital workflows,
depending on their circumstances thus allowing issuers to execute digitalisation
with minimal dependency on verifier technical capabilities.</p>
