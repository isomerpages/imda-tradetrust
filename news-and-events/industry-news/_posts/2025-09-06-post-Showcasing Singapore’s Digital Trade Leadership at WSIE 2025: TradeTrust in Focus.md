<p>Singapore was the Country of Honour at the 2025 World Smart Industry Expo
(WSIE), held from 5–8 September in Chongqing, marking a decade of the China-Singapore
(Chongqing) Connectivity Initiative (CCI) and 35 years of Singapore–China
diplomatic relations. The Expo shone a spotlight on Singapore’s digital
trade and AI innovations, highlighting the strong partnership between the
two nations and creating opportunities for greater cross-border collaboration
and digital infrastructure growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the Singapore Pavilion, TradeTrust joined fellow innovators to showcase
Singapore’s pioneering solutions driving trusted, seamless and interoperable
digital trade. This year, we highlighted the successful adoption of TradeTrust
by AEOTrade, a digital business solution service provider headquartered
in Beijing, and its user community — demonstrating how trusted digital
trade documentation can enhance speed, transparency and efficiency for
businesses in international trade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>TradeTrust, together with AEOTrade, pitched the solution to an invited
audience, including the Chongqing Municipal Commission of Commerce and
Industry, at the Singapore Pavilion — engaging attendees on the real-world
impact and benefits of using <a href="https://www.tradetrust.io/stephen-harwood-an-introduction-to-tradetrust-and-the-laws-governing-electronic-bills-of-lading/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">electronic Bills of Lading (eBLs)</a>,
which are portable across different platforms integrated with <a href="https://www.tradetrust.io/about/what-is-tradetrust/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">TradeTrust framework</a> to
streamline cross-border trade.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>TradeTrust in Action: Chongqing eBL Trial</h4>
<p>A key highlight was the ongoing TradeTrust-enabled eBL pilot with Chongqing,
conducted under the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Connectivity Initiative–
New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor (CCI–ILSTC) Transport &amp; Logistics
pillar and supervised by the Chongqing Port &amp; Logistics Office (CPLO)
and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March 2024, New Land-Sea Corridor Operations (NLSC) and Pacific International
Lines (PIL) Logistics successfully executed a live, fully digital eBL shipment
— using the TradeTrust framework and PIL’s internal system, with records
anchored on the Polygon blockchain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This shipment demonstrated that the end-to-end issuance, transfer, and
surrender of a negotiable Bill of Lading can be done entirely digitally
— eliminating the delays and risks inherent in manual, paper-based processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This live shipment followed a shadow roleplay conducted in December 2021
and marks another milestone towards scalable adoption of cross-border eBLs
between Singapore and Chongqing.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Why This Matters&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Digital trade is key to supporting frictionless global commerce, reducing
costs, and enabling greater resilience in supply chains. By participating
in WSIE 2025 and showcasing real-world use cases such as the Chongqing
eBL pilot, TradeTrust reaffirms its role as a critical piece of digital
trade infrastructure — one that helps governments, platforms, and businesses
adopt legally recognised, trusted, and interoperable digital documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Singapore deepens collaboration with Chongqing under the CCI framework,
initiatives like TradeTrust are paving the way for wider regional adoption
of digital trade solutions — ultimately benefiting shippers, consignees,
carriers, and customs authorities across the trade ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
