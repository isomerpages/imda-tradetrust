<p>We’re proud to share that TradeTrust was recently<strong> </strong>
<a href="https://mag.wcoomd.org/magazine/wco-news-107-issue-2-2025/tradetrusts-journey-since-2021/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">featured in the June 2025 issue of the World Customs Organization (WCO)
News magazine</a>, a respected international publication read widely by
Customs administrations, policymakers, and trade industry stakeholders.</p>
<p>This article, titled “Scaling Digital Trade: TradeTrust’s Journey Since
2021,” charts the progress TradeTrust has made over the past few years
- from concept to execution, from <a href="https://www.tradetrust.io/community/trials/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">pilot trials</a> to powering
live, legally sound, and interoperable trade and trade finance transactions
across borders.</p>
<h3>From Pilots to Production: A Look Back at 2021</h3>
<p>TradeTrust was first featured in WCO News <a href="https://mag.wcoomd.org/magazine/wco-news-94/tradetrust-accelerating-the-digitalization-of-international-trade/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">back in February 2021</a>,
where the article introduced the framework’s foundational vision: to tackle
fragmentation in digital trade by providing a set of globally accepted
standards, legal frameworks, and open-source software. At that point, TradeTrust
was in its early stages, with trials focused on enabling <a href="https://www.tradetrust.io/solution/how-it-works/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">verifiable electronic documents</a> and
exploring legal harmonisation under the <a href="https://www.tradetrust.io/driving-digitalization-of-global-trade-uncitral-model-law-on-electronic-transferable-records/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">United Nations Commission On International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR)</a>.</p>
<h3>2025 Feature: A Testament to Real-World Impact</h3>
<p>Fast forward to 2025, this latest WCO feature reflects just how far TradeTrust
has come. No longer just a promising idea, TradeTrust has matured into
a trusted digital infrastructure used in live, cross-border transactions
— enabling both technical interoperability and legal enforceability of
digital trade documents such us electronic Bills of Lading (eBLs) and electronic
Certificates of Origin (eCOs).</p>
