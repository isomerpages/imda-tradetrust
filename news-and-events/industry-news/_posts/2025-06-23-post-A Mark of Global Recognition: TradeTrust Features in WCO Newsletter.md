<p>We’re proud to share that <strong>TradeTrust was recently </strong><a href="https://mag.wcoomd.org/magazine/wco-news-107-issue-2-2025/tradetrusts-journey-since-2021/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">featured in the June 2025 issue of the World Customs Organization (WCO) News magazine</a>,
a respected international publication read widely by Customs administrations,
policymakers, and trade industry stakeholders.</p>
<p>This article, titled “Scaling Digital Trade: TradeTrust’s Journey Since
2021,” charts the progress TradeTrust has made over the past few years
- from concept to execution, from pilot trials to powering live, legally
sound, and interoperable trade and trade finance transactions across borders.</p>
<h3>From Pilots to Production: A Look Back at 2021</h3>
<p>TradeTrust was first featured in WCO News <a href="https://mag.wcoomd.org/magazine/wco-news-94/tradetrust-accelerating-the-digitalization-of-international-trade/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">back in February 2021</a>,
where the article introduced the framework’s foundational vision: to tackle
fragmentation in digital trade by providing a set of globally accepted
standards, legal frameworks, and open-source software. At that point, TradeTrust
was in its early stages, with trials focused on enabling verifiable electronic
documents and exploring legal harmonisation under the United Nations Commission
On International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Electronic Transferable
Records (MLETR).</p>
<h3>2025 Feature: A Testament to Real-World Impact</h3>
<p>Fast forward to 2025, this latest WCO feature reflects just how far TradeTrust
has come. No longer just a promising idea, TradeTrust has matured into
a trusted digital infrastructure used in <strong>live, cross-border transactions</strong> —
enabling both <strong>technical interoperability</strong> and <strong>legal enforceability</strong> of
digital trade documents such us electronic Bills of Lading (eBLs) and electronic
Certificates of Origin (eCOs).</p>
