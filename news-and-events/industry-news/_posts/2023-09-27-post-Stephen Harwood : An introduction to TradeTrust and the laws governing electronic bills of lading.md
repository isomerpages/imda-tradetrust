<p>The September 2023 edition of Commodities in Focus Weekly by Stephenson
Harwood features TradeTrust and the legal regulations surrounding electronic
bills of lading. The article offers a comprehensive analysis of the legal
and practical aspects of the TradeTrust framework and 'TradeTrust-enabled
eBLs' (TT eBLs), including:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>a user-friendly analysis of the key technical features of TradeTrust which
allow TT eBLs to achieve 'technical interoperability'; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an overview of how TT eBLs comply with the legal requirements for eBLs
under the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (<strong>MLETR</strong>)
and Singapore, English and US law ('legal interoperability'). These laws,
including <strong><em>Singapore's Electronic Transactions Act</em></strong>  <strong><em>2010</em></strong> and
the long-awaited <strong><em>UK Electronic Trade Documents Act 2023</em> </strong>which
took effect on 20 September 2023, plug an important gap in the legal landscape:
the legal recognition of electronic versions of negotiable trade documents
(including eBLs) as equivalent to their paper counterparts</p>
