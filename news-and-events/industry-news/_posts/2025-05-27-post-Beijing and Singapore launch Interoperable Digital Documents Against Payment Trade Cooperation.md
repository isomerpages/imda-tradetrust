<h4><strong>Beijing Two-Zone Office and Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority Launch World’s First Interoperable Digital Documents against Payment Cooperation, Empowering Global Trade and Financial Services with End-to-End Digitalisation&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Jointly driven by the Office of the Leading Group for the Work of the
China (Beijing) Pilot Free Trade Zone and the Integrated National Demonstration
Zone for Opening Up the Services Sector (referred to as the “Beijing Two-Zone
Office”) and Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), the
world’s first project on<strong> interoperable digital Documents against Payment (D/P)</strong>  <strong>for paperless live trades</strong> was
concluded successfully on 9 April 2025. This milestone follows the signing
of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on International Information Industry
and Digital Trade Harbour Cooperation by the Beijing Municipal Commerce
Bureau (Beijing Two-Zone Office) and IMDA in December 2023. Guided by the
Beijing Two-Zone Office and executed by the Beijing Borui Opening-Up Policy
Research Institute, this project marks another achievement in Beijing-Singapore
digital economy collaboration, introducing a novel interoperable trade
finance model for international trade and financial services, paving the
way for business-as-usual digital operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was jointly executed by <strong>COFCO Industrial Food</strong> (also
known as China Processed Food) and <strong>Yit Hong Pte Ltd</strong> in Singapore,
utilising the B2B cross-border e-commerce model (China Customs Code: 9710)
to export canned food containers via sea freight from Xiamen Port to Singapore
Port, with shipping managed by carrier - Pacific International Lines (PIL).
Key participants included the <strong>Bank of China</strong> (BOC) and <strong>Industrial and Commercial Bank of China </strong>(ICBC)
as remitting banks, and <strong>Singapore’s DBS</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>United Overseas Bank </strong>(UOB)
as collecting banks, to support D/P transaction using electronic Bill of
Lading (eBL).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project achieved cross-platforms interoperability between different
digital trade infrastructures (<strong>AEOTrade</strong> and <strong>SGTraDex</strong>),
enabling secure and efficient eBL and other trade documents exchange that
offer authentication, traceability of origin, and ownership transfers among
carriers, cargo owners, banks, and other stakeholders. The eBL, serving
as a digital document of title, not only streamlined customs clearance
and logistics, but also addressed risks such as loss or tampering inherent
in traditional paper-based documentary collections, and enhancing trade
security and credibility. It also transformed the end-to-end international
trade processes, covering contract signing, document circulation, and payment
settlement, and facilitated the fully online electronic document flows
between collecting and remitting banks, significantly shortening transaction
cycles, reducing time costs, and boosting trade efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Chinese participating banks, BOC and ICBC, the transaction
demonstrated that replacing traditional cross-border paper document mailing
with digital transmission had <strong>reduced document circulation costs by 30%</strong>,
and effectively <strong>mitigated risks like document fraud or loss</strong>.
In addition, COFCO Industrial Food pointed out that with the traditional
paper-based D/P processes, the period from shipment to <strong>payment settlement typically took around 20 days, while digitisation slashed this to just five days</strong>, <strong>minimising delays</strong> in <strong>document processing and transfer </strong>while
significantly <strong>improving capital turnover</strong> efficiency. Participating
enterprises in Singapore also confirmed similar results of reducing costs
and improving efficiency. Yit Hong has r<strong>educed documentation handling time by 60%</strong>, <strong>enabling faster goods claims without courier delays</strong>.
Based on PIL’s experience, the <strong>processing time of Bills of Lading </strong>(BL)
has been dramatically reduced from 5-10 days of couriering paper BL to <strong>just 8 minutes per transaction </strong>digitally,
while <strong>eliminating </strong>the <strong>risk of documents</strong> being <strong>lost in transit.</strong> Separately,
DBS highlighted that this transaction reinforced the importance of <strong>interoperability</strong> and <strong>common standards</strong> in
accelerating trade digitalisation and promoting a more efficient global
trade ecosystem, while also <strong>addressing the scalability challenges of closed-loop platforms</strong>.
UOB also recognised from this project that the digital issuance, transfer
and endorsement of a TradeTrust-enabled eBL allowed banks to <strong>efficiently establish the authenticity of a BL</strong>  <strong>without a separate validation process</strong>.
When scaled, this can help to <strong>mitigate risk of trade finance fraud</strong> and <strong>strengthen confidence</strong> in
cross-border trade finance.</p>
<p>Prior to this, COFCO and Yit Hong had implemented end-to-end interoperable
digital trade collaborations in October 2023 (with PIL as the carrier)
and May 2024 (with Maersk as the carrier), utilising telegraphic transfer
(T/T) payments. These successful pilots laid a solid foundation for the
current digital D/P implementation, expanding interoperable trade financing
process in international trade finance.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the Beijing Two-Zone Office and IMDA will leverage the
“AEOTradeChain+TradeTrust” framework to explore broader end-to-end interoperable
digital trade scenarios. These efforts will engage more countries, regions,
industries, and business types, inviting participation from cargo owners,
financial institutions, logistics providers, and other stakeholders to
jointly advance the digital transformation of global trade and financial
services, injecting new momentum into the sector.</p>
<h4>Collaboration bridges digital trade platforms: AEOTrade and SGTraDex sign MoU</h4>
<p>As Singapore’s digital infrastructure for supply chain data, SGTraDex
enables trusted and structured cross-border data exchange, enhancing traceability,
transparency, and confidence in trade. This successful collaboration demonstrated
the transformative potential of interoperable digital ecosystems, culminating
in the signing of a MoU with AEOTrade. As part of the MoU, both parties
will explore opportunities to integrate their infrastructure and solutions
to support digital documents, such as eBLs, to enhance connectivity between
the China and Singapore’s trade ecosystems. These include aligning strategic
plans, conducting joint feasibility studies, and ensuring compliance with
applicable regulations.</p>
