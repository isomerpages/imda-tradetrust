<h4>Supported by Beijing Two-Zone Office and Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority, COFCO and Yit Hong Expand <strong>End-to-End Interoperable Trade Digitalization Network by Completing</strong> New Pilot</h4>
<p></p>
<p>On May 6, 2024, COFCO and its Singapore client Yit Hong completed a new
cross-border end-to-end interoperable paperless trade, with Maersk as the
carrier. The pilot was supported by the Beijing Municipal Commerce Bureau
(Beijing Two-Zone Office) and Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority
(IMDA), as their first collaborative outcome following the signing of an
MOU on International Information Industry and Digital Trade Harbor Cooperation.
It will also facilitate COFCO and Yit Hong in expanding their digitalized
trade network by onboarding additional partners and pioneering further
end-to-end scenarios on a business-as-usual basis.</p>
<p>The shipment from Xiamen, China to Singapore was carried by Maersk and
involved COFCO China Processed Food (COFCO CPF, also known as COFCO Industrial
Food) exporting a container of canned food to Yit Hong. Maersk issued an
electronic Bill of Lading (eBL) on April 25th and accepted its surrender
on May 2nd on AEOTradeChain which is supported by IMDA’s TradeTrust framework.
AEOTradeChain is a blockchain network developed by Beijing-based firm AEOTrade,
serving as the Secretariat of the Beijing TradeTech Alliance, it ensures
interoperability across its underlying blockchain technologies, such as
ChainMaker and Astron. All trading processes for the sellers and buyers,
including contract signings, customs clearances, transfers of eBL title
ownership and payments were fully paperless. Transacting parties are given
end-to-end track and traceability of the shipment in real time on a single
screen.</p>
<p>Trials Paving the Way Towards a Viable Model for Industry to Adopt as
a “Business As Usual” Approach for Trade Digitalization</p>
<p>In October 2023, COFCO CPF and Yit Hong completed the first cross-border
end-to-end interoperable paperless trade between China and Singapore, involving
a TradeTrust-enabled eBL that was issued by Pacific International Lines
on the international blockchain network interoperating with AEOTradeChain.
Also in August 2023, the first fully paperless interoperable trade finance
trial was successfully conducted between Singapore and India, with Maersk
as the carrier issuing a TradeTrust-enabled eBL.</p>
<p>The above international groundbreaking trials demonstrate that end-to-end
interoperable digitalization of trade can reduce costs and enhance efficiency
for all trading parties. It is estimated that COFCO CPF can reduce its
business operation costs by over 30% through end-to-end digitalization
of their trading processes. As a leading company in the food sector, COFCO
could incentivize its trading partners to join the digital trade network
through profit-sharing, achieving a win-win situation for all parties on
a business-as-usual basis.</p>
<p>Going forward, the Beijing Two-Zone Office and IMDA will continue to collaborate
with industry players, actively promote commercial trade digitalization
trials, and improve cross-system interoperability and scalability.</p>
