<p>TradeTrust partner <a href="https://www.credore.xyz/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Credore</a> has officially been <a href="https://www.igpandi.org/article/ig-approved-electronic-bill-of-lading-systems/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">deemed approved by the International Group of P&amp;I Clubs (IG P&amp;I)</a> to
issue <a href="https://www.tradetrust.io/video-lf-decentralized-trust-on-mletr-legal-principles-and-implementation-singapore-tradetrust/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MLETR</a>-compliant
<a href="https://www.tradetrust.io/industry-news-tradetrust-s-approach-to-electronic-bills-of-lading/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">electronic Bills of Lading (eBLs)</a>– a milestone achieved in just over
40 days. This highlights the readiness of TradeTrust’s legal and technical
frameworks, as well as its compliance with complex regulatory processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IG P&amp;I provides marine liability cover for around 90% of the world’s
ocean-going tonnage. Securing deemed approval from IG P&amp;I is a significant
milestone for any digital trade platform issuing eBLs. To receive this
approval, platforms using eBLs must undergo a rigorous assessment process,
during which their systems are required to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Comply with laws recognising that eBLs are equivalent to paper bills&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide evidence of contract of carriage terms&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have system functionality for transfer rejections and accomplishment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deemed Approval made easier with TradeTrust&nbsp;</h3>
<h4>TradeTrust’s legal readiness&nbsp;</h4>
<p>TradeTrust’s <a href="https://www.tradetrust.io/about/legality-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Model Law Terms</a> played
a pivotal role in helping Credore attain IG P&amp;I deemed approval by
providing a strong legal foundation. This reduced the time needed for legal
review and back-and-forth and accelerated the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TradeTrust’s Model Terms, released in 2025 and drafted by international
law firm Watson Farley &amp; Williams, are structured in three parts:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Part A – Definitions: Establish precise definitions used in the Model
Terms.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Part B – Terms to be incorporated in User Agreement Terms and Conditions:
Govern the relationship between platforms and their users, covering crucial
aspects such as eBL clausing, rejection mechanisms, switch-to-paper procedures,
surrender and accomplishment processes, liability considerations, and governing
law and dispute resolution frameworks; and&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Part C - TradeTrust eBL provisions: Align to statutory law and should
be incorporated into every TradeTrust eBL governed by an <a href="https://www.tradetrust.io/driving-digitalization-of-global-trade-uncitral-model-law-on-electronic-transferable-records/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MLETR</a>.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These Model Terms provided the legal foundation for TradeTrust-enabled
eBLs to meet the requirements for deemed approval by IG P&amp;I.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Technically aligned with IG P&amp;I’s requirements</h4>
<p>Credore operates on Version 5 of TradeTrust’s Token Registry.</p>
<p>This version included support for remarks, allowing users to document
additional contexts for all actions. It also enabled users to reject transfers,
giving users greater control over transfers while ensuring that records
return to their rightful parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both functions address key components of IG P&amp;I’s system reliability
requirements while enhancing the user’s ability to manage transferable
records.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Steadfast support throughout the process</h4>
<p>Throughout the application, the TradeTrust team provided close support,
assisting Credore in addressing IG P&amp;I’s queries clearly and efficiently
to obtain deemed approval.</p>
