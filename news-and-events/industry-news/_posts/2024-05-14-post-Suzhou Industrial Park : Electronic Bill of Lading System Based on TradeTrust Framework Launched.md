<p><strong>New Breakthrough in Digital Trade in Suzhou Industrial Park: Electronic Bill of Lading System Based on TradeTrust Framework Officially Launched</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) successfully piloted the first electronic
bill of lading（eBL）based on the adaptation of IMDA’s TradeTrust framework
with AEOTradeChain, utilising the Astron blockchain network. This milestone
marks progress of the park's self-developed eBL system to the stage of
practical application.</p>

<p>This trial involves Suzhou Higer Bus Company exporting buses from China
to Philippines, carried by Maersk Line which is currently ranked as the
world’s second-largest container carrier. The eBL was issued using a distributed
eBL system，AEOTradeChain &amp; TradeTrust e-Docs System， in compliance
with the TradeTrust framework and transferred through the AEOTradeChain
trusted trade collaboration network supported by Astron.</p>

<p>The eBL system supports the distributed circulation and verification of
eBL among shipping companies, importers and exporters, freight forwarders,
and other trade collaborators. Leveraging blockchain technology, it facilities
functions such as process collaborative management, data deposit verification,
and data privacy protection, ensuring the authenticity, uniqueness, security,
and traceability of eBLs.</p>
<p>In traditional international trade, the courier of paper bill of lading
takes 5 to 10 days. In contrast, the process of issuing, endorsement, and
surrendering digital bills of lading is now completed within 2 days when
using eBL, with users requiring less than 3 hours to transact online. The
digital document flow also reduces the redundant costs of printing and
couriering original paper documents, providing a practical solution for
green and low-carbon cross-border trade.</p>
<p>AEOTradeChain trusted trade collaboration network is an open and neutral
distributed trade data exchange and sharing infrastructure. Trade enterprises,
logistics companies, financial institutions, industry organisations, governments,
and other institutions in the trade chain are connected to AEOTradeChain
for achieving end-to-end data exchange and trustworthy transactions. Thereby
promoting the digitisation of the entire trade chain from deal matching,
logistics and transportation, cross-border customs clearance, freight insurance,
payment, and financial services. It forms a new trade digital community
that is open, neutral, and inclusive.</p>
