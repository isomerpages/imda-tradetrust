<p>This paper by UN/CEFACT, describes a highly scalable operating model for
digitisation and trust of cross border trade basedon verifiable credentials,
linked data, and decentralised identifiers. It provides national regulators
with implementation guidance.</p>
<p>Read about TradeTrust in section 6.5 page 34 :</p>
<p>6.5 Open Attestation and Tradetrust</p>
<p>Singapore developed OpenAttestation (seehttps://<a href="http://www.openattestation.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.openattestation.com/</a>) to
enable documents issued with this technology to be cryptographically trustworthy
and able to be verified independently. OpenAttestation provides the technology
underpinnings of TradeTrust (see https://<a href="http://www.tradetrust.io" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.tradetrust.io</a>)whichis an open framework
adapted for global trade practices to help the typically long chain of
business partners achieve the ultimate objective of fully digitalising
their business processes even across borders. Given thecomplexities of
cross-border trade, success needs a multi-prong yet holistic approach.
As such, withOpenAttestation providing the technology foundations, TradeTrust
adds aspects such as acceptance by theglobal trade community and governments
on the methods of document digitalisation as well as alignment onpolicy
stances through G2G arrangements such as Digital Economy Agreements. These
efforts have resultedin the following W3C verifiable credentials-related
features being implemented:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Decentralised document rendering protocol enables users to choose
their own document schemaformat, and to customise the look and feel of
the trade documents produced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selective Redaction provides a convenient method for intermediaries in
the supply chain to hidesensitive data, which is critical for some use
cases in the trade and traceability domains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Title Transfer feature supports electronic transferable records and
is designed to be compliant tothe requirements laid out in UNCITRALâ€™s Model
Law on Electronic Transferable Records (2017).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The QR Code feature enables users to choose using paper or digital workflows,
depending on theircircumstances thus allowing issuers to execute digitalisation
with minimal dependency on verifiertechnical capabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The UNCEFACT repository https://<a href="http://github.com/uncefact/spec-tradetrustprovides" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">github.com/uncefact/spec-tradetrust</a> provides
additional guidance on the effective use of TradeTrust.</p>
