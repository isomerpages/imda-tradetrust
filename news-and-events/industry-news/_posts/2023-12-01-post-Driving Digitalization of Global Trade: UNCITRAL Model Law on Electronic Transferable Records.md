<p>The article published by Asian Development Bank (ADB) highlights how trading
of physical goods globally, worth a massive $25.3 trillion, still relies
heavily on paperwork. The article also explains how Model Law on Electronic
Transferable Records (MLETR) by UNCITRAL, can help make the process more
efficient, cost effective, and transparent. The article points out that
there is a growing trend towards using trade digitalization and mentions
how Asian Development Bank (ADB) is helping countries in adopting this
approach. It's a call for governments and the industry to collaborate and
actively promote digitalization for global trade through initiatives like
TradeTrust.</p>
