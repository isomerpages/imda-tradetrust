<p>On 6 November, ASTRON Network’s case, <em>‘Building Global Cross-Border Digital Trust Bridges, Co-Creating an Open and Trusted Digital Ecosystem’ </em>was
honoured as one of 12 Outstanding Cases at the 2025 World Internet Conference
(WIC) Wuzhen Summit, out of 300 submissions received worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Submitted by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology
(CAICT), the project was awarded in the Network Infrastructure Construction
category as a standout case of innovation and impact in the digital trade
space. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Li Haihua, the Deputy Head of the Informatisation and Institute for Industrial
Internet &amp; Internet of Things (IIIIoT) at the CAICT noted TradeTrust’s
involvement in the project, stating, “The successful collaboration between
the ASTRON Network and TradeTrust is a prime example of building an open
and trusted digital ecosystem. By enabling the digital transmission and
mutual recognition of trade documents through blockchain technology, the
partnership has significantly enhanced the efficiency and security of cross-border
trade, while providing a replicable pathway for developing an open and
trusted digital environment.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a collaborator in the project, the recognition represents another important
milestone for TradeTrust, highlighting the global significance of using
Digital Documents against Payment (D/P) in enhancing international trade
efficiency and security.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>TradeTrust and ASTRON: Collaborating to Transform Cross-Border Trade&nbsp;</h3>
<p>ASTRON Network, launched by CAICT in 2021, leverages blockchain technology
to build cross-border digital trust infrastructure. TradeTrust relies on
public blockchain technology to electronically endorse and transfer the
title ownership of a document among stakeholders. Public blockchains allow
for an open and interoperable system, enabling all international parties
to participate. TradeTrust's (D/P) trade financing trials between China
and Singapore catalysed ASTRON's advancement to a crypto-less EVM compatible
Layer-2 variant, designed to comply with Chinese regulatory constraints.
This made ASTRON Network the only China-initiated public blockchain infrastructure
in TradeTrust's framework, which also includes Ethereum, Polygon, XDC,
and STABILITY (crypto-less).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Presenting at the “Release and Presentation of Outstanding Cases of Jointly
Building a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace” ceremony at the
2025 WIC Wuzhen Summit, ASTRON Network highlighted TradeTrust’s role in
the Digital D/P trial, which demonstrated how TradeTrust’s interoperability
and secure framework helped ASTRON Network advance cross-border digital
trade.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Real-world Impacts of Interoperable and Trusted Cross-border Transactions&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.tradetrust.io/beijing-and-singapore-launch-interoperable-digital-documents-against-payment-trade-corporation/" class="Hyperlink SCXW228247981 BCX0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>successful trial</u></a> by
TradeTrust, supported by ASTRON Network, and involving COFCO Industrial
Food, Singapore’s Yit Hong Pte Ltd, major banks and Pacific International
Lines (PIL) as the carrier, demonstrated the real-world benefits of using
interoperable and trusted electronic Bills of Lading (eBL) to enhance the
efficiency and security of cross-border trade.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>Shorter processing times</em>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>By replacing traditional cross-border paper document mailing with digital
transmission, the time taken from shipment to payment settlement was significantly
reduced from 20 days to five days. Yit Hong Pte Ltd cut documentation handling
time by 60%, while PIL reduced the processing time for Bills of Lading
from 5 to 10 days to only 8 minutes per transaction.</p>
<p>Participating Chinese banks, BOC and ICBC, noted that replacing traditional
cross-border paper document mailing with digital transmission also reduced
document circulation costs by 30% while effectively mitigating risks like
document fraud or loss.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>Lower risk of fraud and tampering&nbsp;</em></h4>
<p>This trial was supported by ASTRON’s crypto-less public blockchain solutions,
ensuring regulatory compliance with no business-on-chain data or cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participating bank UOB highlighted that the digital issuance, transfer
and endorsement of a TradeTrust-enabled eBL allowed banks to efficiently
establish the authenticity of the eBL without a separate validation process.
The process also mitigated risks of trade finance fraud and strengthened
confidence in cross-border trade finance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>Seamless transactions enabled through interoperability</em>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>A key feature of the TradeTrust-enabled eBLs is the seamless transfer
across TradeTrust-ready platforms, giving trading partners the flexibility
to use their preferred systems, such as AEOTrade and SGTraDex. This decentralised
approach means parties no longer need to operate on a common digital platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another participating bank, DBS, noted that the transaction reinforced
the importance of interoperability and common standards in accelerating
trade digitalisation and promoting a more efficient global trade ecosystem,
while also addressing the scalability challenges of closed-loop platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What this means for the future of trade&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The successful trial showcases how secure and efficient document exchange
across TradeTrust-enabled trade platforms can streamline international
trade and finance processes.&nbsp;</p>
