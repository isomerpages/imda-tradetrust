<h4><strong>Beijing Two-Zone Office and Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority Drive the Launch of First China-Singapore-Middle East End-to-End Interoperable Trade Digitalisation Pilot</strong></h4>
<p>The first end-to-end interoperable trade digitalisation pilot between
China, Singapore, and the Middle East, jointly promoted by the Office of
the Leading Group for the Work of the China (Beijing) Pilot Free Trade
Zone and the Integrated National Demonstration Zone for Opening up the
Services Sector (referred to as the "Beijing Two-Zone Office") and Singapore’s
Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), was successfully completed
on 11 March, 2025.</p>
<p>The pilot, implemented by Minimax (Beijing) Fire Fighting System Co.,Ltd.,
entrusted Singapore shipping company Pacific International Lines (PIL)
to transport a firefighting equipment container by sea from Shanghai Port
to Dammam/Jeddah Port in Saudi Arabia and then by land to Minimax’s project
location in Jazan. The pilot was supported by AEOTrade, which initiated
blockchain technology through a trusted trade cooperation network (AEOTradeChain)
and IMDA’s TradeTrust framework, to enable the issuance of electronic bills
of lading (eBLs) by PIL.</p>
<p>The pilot focused on two core innovations in the “electronic transferable
document” process: First, the development of a “blockchain-based certification
+ dual-platform verification” mechanism, which recorded the data hash values
of 11 key points in the process of issuing, transferring, and clearing
eBLs on the block chain; second, the introduction of the “China-Singapore
Cooperation + Middle East Application Scenario” integration model, which
enabled the cross-border connectivity and secure sharing of 28 trade data
items.</p>
<p>According to participating companies, the pilot demonstrated that the
use of transferable documents like eBLs supported by a distributed system
improved the efficiency of cargo rights transfer by 80% (from 5-7 days
to real-time delivery) and increased logistics traceability by 65%. The
cross-border digital collaboration system also <strong>reduced compliance costs by 40% (saving approximately USD$120 per order)</strong>, <strong>shortened the eBL circulation time from the traditional 7 days to 8 hours</strong>,
and achieved <strong>100% visibility in goods-in-transit management</strong>, <strong>while improving customs clearance efficiency by 60%</strong>.
This pilot has enjoyed strong support from Beijing’s Fengtai District government,
which is also a trade facilitation demonstration project in Fengtai, marking
an important step forward in the District’s trade facilitation effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In recent years, international trade between Belt and Road countries,
particularly China, Singapore, and the Middle East, has flourished. The
successful implementation of this pilot provides a model for promoting
international trade digitalisation and cooperation among Belt and Road
countries. Moving forward, the Beijing Two-Zone Office and Singapore’s
IMDA will continue to collaborate with all parties to expand digital trade
applications, deepen cooperation with other Belt and Road countries in
the digital economy, and help build a more efficient and convenient international
trade environment.</p>
