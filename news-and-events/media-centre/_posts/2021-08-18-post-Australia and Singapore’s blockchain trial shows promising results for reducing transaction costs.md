<p>Australian Border Force (ABF), the Infocomm Media Development Authority
of Singapore (IMDA), and Singapore Customs, along with industry participants,
have concluded a blockchain trial to prove trade documents can be issued
and verified digitally across two independent systems, reducing cross-border
transaction costs.</p>
<p>The blockchain trial was initiated as part of the Singapore - Australia
Digital Economy Agreement to make cross-border trade simpler between the
two countries. The trial successfully tested the interoperability of two
digital verification systems – the ABF’s Intergovernmental Ledger (IGL)
and IMDA’s TradeTrust reference implementation.</p>
<p>The trial demonstrated Australia’s capability in issuing high integrity
digital trade documents that can be instantly authenticated, provenance
traced, and digitally processed. QR-codes embedded with unique proofs are
inserted into digital Certificates of Origin (COO), enabling immediate
verification for authenticity and integrity of the document when scanned
or machine-read.</p>
<p>A key success of the trial is the acceptance of verifiable COOs by a regulatory
authority, Singapore Customs. Trial participants from industry, including
the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Australian Industry Group,
ANZ Bank, DBS Bank, Standard Chartered and Rio Tinto, noted the benefits
of improved efficiency through time and cost savings by using verifiable
COOs.</p>
<p>ABF Commissioner Michael Outram said he was pleased with the positive
results which will contribute to improving cross-border processes for Australian
trading community.</p>
<p>“ABF is proud to pioneer cutting-edge digital verification projects in
Australia. We understand this collaboration is among the first to involve
multiple government agencies from two countries to achieve cross-border
document interoperability.</p>
<p>“Digital verification and verifiable documents show promise as a ‘circuit-breaker’
to disrupt persistent paper-based evidence required by authorities,” Commissioner
Outram said.</p>
<p>The goal of the IGL platform is to progressively remove the need for paper
documents and reduce cross-border transaction costs for Australian business,
consistent with commitments under the Simplified Trade System reform agenda.</p>
<p>Both IGL and the TradeTrust reference implementation use the TradeTrust
framework as the key underlying technology to allow interoperability, so
the document can be verified by both systems. TradeTrust’s approach to
verification provides flexibility to allow documents to be verified not
only in digital format but also when the documents are converted into a
paper document at any point of the transaction.</p>
<p>Mr Lew Chuen Hong, Chief Executive of IMDA said: “IMDA spearheads the
development of digital utilities as baseline infrastructure for the digital
economy. As one such utility, TradeTrust helps verify documents for more
efficient cross-border trade. This successful trial demonstrates TradeTrust’s
value as a framework to connect governments and businesses for more effective
trade flow."</p>
<p>COOs are usually issued on paper and businesses regularly wait days to
receive the hard-copy document via courier before dispatching to multiple
parties, including customs agencies, brokers, and banks. Paper trade documents
are generally required by authorities to prove authenticity and integrity.</p>
<p>Mr Ho Chee Pong, Director-General, Singapore Customs said the COVID-19
pandemic has accelerated trade digitalisation, and demonstrated the importance
of cross-border paperless trade.</p>
<p>“Singapore Customs appreciates the close collaboration with Australia
in this aspect, and looks forward to further collaboration in promoting
paperless trade,” Mr Ho added.</p>
<p>In using this blockchain-based, decentralised approach, transactions can
become more cost effective and offers scalability without the need for
expensive data exchange infrastructure, lowering barriers to the adoption
of paperless cross-border trade.</p>
