<h4><strong>World's Largest Business Organisation Joins Singapore Government and Major Industry Partners to Drive Global Digitalisation</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p><strong>DAVOS, SWITZERLAND – 22 JAN 2020</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Convening alongside the annual World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in
Davos, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), with 45 million institutional
members in 130 countries, has joined the Singapore Government and a growing
consortium of key industry partners to accelerate the digitalisation of
global trade and commerce</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>ICC, the Singapore Government, and major firms from key industries have
signed a historic cooperation agreement to facilitate and accelerate adoption
of digital technologies in trade and commerce. The global industry leaders
participating in the agreement are APRIL, DBS Bank, Marubeni Corporation,
Mastercard, Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd., Mizuho Bank,
Ltd., MUFG Bank, Noble, NTT DATA, PSA International, Sompo Japan Nipponkoa,
Standard Chartered Bank, Sumitomo Corporation, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corporation, Tokio Marine, and Trafigura.</p>
<p>This public-private partnership between global organisations will be a
significant leap forward to shift international trade from a paper-based
system to digitally-enabled trade. It will create enormous potential value
based on time and operational cost savings combined with the greatly reduced
incidence of fraud and human error.</p>
<p>“Digital platforms will lower existing barriers to international trade
in the coming years and enable many more businesses to participate in the
new global economy. In line with ICC’s 21st century purpose, we are committed
to enabling the broadest possible adoption of these digital technologies
and support the development and recognition of universally accepted best
practice standards for digitalisation, based on global consensus and the
work being done by our partners today,” said John W.H. Denton AO, ICC Secretary
General.</p>
<p>As one of the largest global trading hubs, Singapore is capitalising on
its strong networks to bring together an efficient and unified process
of digitalised trade. The country is partnering various international organisations,
governments and industry players on the development of TradeTrust - a multilateral,
open legal and technical framework, that enables inter-operability across
different trade platforms and formats for the exchange of digital trade
documents on a public blockchain. This strategic initiative is led by the
Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) with the Maritime Port Authority
(MPA), and supported by partner agency, Enterprise Singapore.</p>
<p>One of the first platforms built on the TradeTrust framework is ICC TradeFlow.
ICC TradeFlow was co-developed by ICC together with trade tech firm, Perlin,
in collaboration with IMDA, commodities trader Trafigura, and DBS Bank.
A landmark USD20M pilot trade was executed on ICC TradeFlow in November
2019, with an iron ore shipment from South Africa to China. To further
support the industry-wide digitalisation, partners in this pilot trade
are making further major trade volume commitments to be executed on this
platform.</p>
