<p>A recording of the Hyperledger Trade Finance Special Interest Group on
April 27, 2021. On how the UN CITRAL Model Law on Electronic transferable
Records is impacting Trade Finance and its digitisation. Mr Luca Castellani
from UN CITRAL, and Kay Ren Yuh, senior project manager of Singapore IMDA,
drove us through the a very informative outlook on the adoption of MLETR
and the implementation of the project called Singapore Trade Trust with
some very interesting hints on the future development of the project itself.
An excellent starting point for digitisation of Trade Finance and Open
Source Enterprise Blockchain solutions.</p>
