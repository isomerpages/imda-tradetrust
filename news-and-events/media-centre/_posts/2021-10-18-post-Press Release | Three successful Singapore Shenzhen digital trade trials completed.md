<h4>Three Successful Digital Cross-Border Trade Trials Completed: Businesses Will Be Able To Benefit from Faster and More Secured Transactions</h4>
</blockquote>
<h4>Trials on Digital Trade To Promote Business Productivity</h4>
<p>Businesses between Singapore and Shenzhen can also soon enjoy expeditious
cross-border trade financing transactions as the SCI continues to deepen
technological cooperation and test policy innovations between both cities.</p>
<p>Enabled by IMDAâ€™s TradeTrust digital utility, banks, shipping lines, buyers,
sellers, platform service providers and fintech companies have collaborated
on successful technical trials on trade financing using simulated electronic
Bills of Lading<sup>1</sup> (<strong>eBLs</strong>). UOB, together with
its Shenzhen Branch in China, and their clients have successfully concluded
two digital trade financing technical trials. DBS Singapore, DBS China
and their client have also conducted a third successful technical trial.
Other banks including Bank of China Singapore Branch and Shenzhen Branch,
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Shenzhen Branch and Singapore Branch,
and MUFG Bank will also be launching trade financing pilots in the coming
months. After the successful technical trials, the banks intend for commercial
transactions to follow.</p>
<p>The three successful trials demonstrated how key maritime trade documents
like the eBL could be used across different trade financing platforms and
jurisdictions. With the digitalisation of the paper-based Bill of Lading,
shipping and finance industries along with businesses in Shenzhen and Singapore
will enjoy faster transactions (e.g. there would no longer be a need to
physically transport or manage hardcopy trade documents, cost and time
savings and lowered fraud risks through the use of digital verification
systems).</p>

<p><strong>Footnote</strong>
</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Bills of Lading are documents which acknowledge receipt of
cargo for shipment and also prove ownership of the cargo. An importer will
incur additional storage and handling costs if a paper BL arrives at the
destination port later than the cargo or suffer losses if the BL has been
tampered with.</p>
