<p>This is TradeTrust's pitch at the WSA Winners' Pitching Sessions, where
WSA winners who weren't able to pitch at Planet_ Hack_ _ got a chance to
pitch to a panel of jurors. TradeTrust was designed to address the challenges
of paper-based international trade, reduces costs of documentation and
risks of fraud.</p>
