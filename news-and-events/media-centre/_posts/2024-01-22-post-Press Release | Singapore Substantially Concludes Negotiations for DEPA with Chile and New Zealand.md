<p><strong>SINGAPORE – 22 JAN 2020</strong>
</p>
<h4>Singapore Substantially Concludes Negotiations for Digital Economy Partnership Agreement with Chile and New Zealand</h4>
<p>Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing, New Zealand’s Minister
for Trade and Export Growth David Parker and Chile’s Vice Minister for
Trade Rodrigo Yanez jointly announced the substantial conclusion of the
negotiations for the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (<strong>DEPA</strong>)
in Singapore today.</p>
<p>Mr Chan Chun Sing said, “The DEPA is a new form of economic engagement
in the digital era that Singapore has embarked on with like-minded partners
Chile and New Zealand. I am encouraged that our countries have worked collaboratively
and expeditiously to achieve substantial conclusion of negotiations. As
the nature of commerce and trade evolves due to digitalisation, it is important
that we build new forms of cross-border linkages in order to create opportunities
for our businesses to thrive in the digital economy. I would like to thank
officials from the Ministry of Trade and Industry, Ministry of Communications
and Information and the Infocomm Media Development Authority for working
closely to bring this agreement to fruition which has allowed us to pursue
these digital initiatives.”</p>
<p>In addition to establishing rules for digital trade, the DEPA fosters
cooperation in emerging digital areas. It promotes interoperability between
different regimes by aligning standards and addressing new issues brought
about by digitalisation. Some of these novel elements include e-invoicing,
digital identities, Fintech, artificial intelligence, data flows and data
innovation, trade and investment opportunities for SMEs, and digital inclusivity.</p>
<p>The DEPA represents a building block towards fostering greater digital
connectivity between countries and developing multilateral rules on digital
trade at the WTO. It will complement Singapore’s network of free trade
agreements and our efforts as co-convener of the World Trade Organisation
Joint Statement Initiative on E-Commerce to develop baseline digital trade
rules.</p>
<p>Singapore, Chile and New Zealand enjoy longstanding and warm relations.
The substantial conclusion of DEPA negotiations demonstrates our robust
partnership and will serve to increase digital connectivity and strengthen
economic ties between our countries.</p>
