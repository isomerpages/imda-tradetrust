<h1><strong>Collaboration combines the reach, scale and reliability of SWIFT with IMDA’s efforts on technology and legal frameworks to accelerate trade digitalisation</strong></h1>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>SWIFT and Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) today
signed a Memorandum of Intent (MOI) to accelerate trade digitalisation
globally.</p>
<p>The MOI looks at offering SWIFT’s community of more than 11,000 financial
institutions and corporates in over 200 countries and territories more
efficient and cost-effective cross-border paperless trade, without the
need for multiple bilateral linkages and siloed systems. Moving manual
processes to digitally enabled ones also creates opportunities to shorten
trade processing times and open up possibilities for innovation such as
new trade financing offerings to the trade community.</p>
<p>Through this MOI, both parties will work to combine TradeTrust, an interoperability
framework that connects various platforms for the exchange of digital trade
documentation, with the SWIFT community. TradeTrust provides proof of authenticity
of documents and offers title transfer through open-source software<sup>1</sup>.
This functions alongside legal harmonisation to recognise these digital
documents. When paired with SWIFT’s ability to securely transport industry
standardised electronic trade messaging, scanned hardcopy documentation
and digitally signed assets, this will pave the way for the seamless exchange
of electronic trade documents around the world.</p>
<p>As an important global trade and finance hub, Singapore has been at the
forefront of trade digitalisation, partnering with various international
organisations, governments and industry players to boost cross-border trade.
This MOI further builds on IMDA’s effort to bring in new partners to join
this global trade digitalisation effort. Earlier this year, IMDA signed
a cooperation agreement with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)
and 17 multinational firms to move from existing paper-based processes
to digitally enabled ones.</p>
<p>Mr. Alain Raes, Chief Business Development Officer, SWIFT, said: <strong>“</strong><em>The trade ecosystem faces digital disruption and requires open standards, legal harmonisation and coming together as a community to address fragmentation, friction and risks. Our collaboration with Singapore’s global TradeTrust initiative allows us to play a central role in this effort, and we look forward to working together towards a shared vision of a frictionless, dynamic, global trade ecosystem.”</em>
</p>
<p>Ms Jane Lim, Assistant Chief Executive, IMDA, said: “<em>International trade is the lifeblood of Singapore’s economy. Singapore is working with various partners internationally to develop an interoperability framework, TradeTrust, for the seamless and efficient exchange of digitalised trade documentation across different communities. We are pleased to partner with SWIFT to further develop a trusted, interoperable and global digital trade ecosystem</em>.”</p>
