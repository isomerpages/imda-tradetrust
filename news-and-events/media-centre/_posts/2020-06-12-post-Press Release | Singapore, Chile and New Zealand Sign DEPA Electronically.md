<p><strong>SINGAPORE – 12 JUN 2020</strong>
</p>
<h4>Singapore, Chile and New Zealand Sign Digital Economy Partnership Agreement Electronically</h4>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing, New Zealand’s Minister
for Trade and Export Growth David Parker and Chile’s Minister of Foreign
Affairs Teodoro Ribera Neumann signed the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement
(DEPA) electronically via videoconference today. The signing of the agreement
affirmed the commitment of Singapore, Chile and New Zealand to deepen collaboration
in the digital economy.</p>
<p>The DEPA is the first digital economy agreement that Singapore has concluded
and signed. The electronic signing underlines the opportunities offered
by digital connectivity in enabling business continuity during the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic. The agreement fosters cooperation on key emerging issues
in the digital economy and promotes interoperability between the systems
of different countries. Singapore businesses can look forward to benefits
such as improved efficiency, reduced cost and increased trust when conducting
business and trading digitally with their overseas partners in these two
countries.</p>
<p>Mr Chan said, “The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly accelerated the pace
of digital transformation globally. As more businesses carry out their
activities in the digital sphere, agreements such as the DEPA will be even
more critical in helping businesses transact and trade seamlessly. Singapore
will continue to work closely with Chile and New Zealand, and other like-minded
partners, to strengthen our digital connectivity and enable our businesses
to better tap on the opportunities in the digital economy.”</p>
<p>The DEPA parties have begun to embark on joint projects to operationalise
key aspects of the DEPA. For example, Singapore is working with New Zealand
on the International Connectivity System (ICS), which will include the
exchange of e-certificates for animal products such as meat and meat products
with New Zealand.</p>
<p>Businesses are encouraged to participate in Singapore’s digitalisation
initiatives such as the SME Go Digital programme and Nationwide E-invoicing
Network, which are aligned to DEPA, to reach more international markets
and enjoy the benefits of participating in the digital economy.</p>
