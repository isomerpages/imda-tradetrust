<h2>World’s first live electronic transferable record (ETR) cross-border trade through TradeTrust</h2>
<h4>31 Mar 2023</h4>
<p>Singapore – 30th March 2023 Singapore pushes the boundaries of digitalisation
for global trade as the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) partnered
industry players and successfully executed a live shipment from Singapore
to Thailand during Q1 2023. This fully paperless, live cross-border trade
involved the use of an ETR, that is functionally equivalent to a paper
Bill of Lading (BL) using Singapore’s TradeTrust framework.</p>
<p>Pioneered by IMDA, TradeTrust was designed to address the challenges of
paper-based cross-border trades, leveraging international standards and
frameworks, utilising blockchain-powered technology to enable digitalisation
of transferable documents into ETR. IMDA’s TradeTrust framework harmonises
the legal recognition of digital documentations between various jurisdictions
which has adopted the United Nations Commission on International Trade
Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR ).</p>
<p>The world’s first ETR cross-border trade involved ExxonMobil Asia Pacific
Pte. Ltd. as the shipper, Bunkerchain as the TradeTrust-enabled digital
platform provider and VLK as the vessel owner who is supported by their
Protection &amp; Indemnity (P&amp;I) Club. Bunkerchain provided a digital
solution that supported the key logistics documentation processes for the
cross-border liquid chemical trade involving multiple parties such as a
surveyor and custom broker. The use of TradeTrust has enabled the digitalisation
of the issuance, ownership title transfer and surrender of the ETR as an
electronic Bill of Lading (eBL) between the different stakeholders across
different systems, that is compliant to the UNCITRAL MLETR requirements.</p>
<p><strong>How the Shipment was Conducted</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>ExxonMobil Asia Pacific shipped liquid chemicals from Singapore to Thailand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VLK issued an electronic Bill of Lading (eBL) using Bunkerchain, a TradeTrust-enabled
digital platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of Marine Vessel Pass, a joint project between S&amp;P Global
Market Intelligence and Bunkerchain, created a Digital Passports for Ships
on the eBL ensured that digital identity used in the signing, was onboarded,
and verified by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. This was tied to their
International maritime organization number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The eBL was subsequently surrendered on the TradeTrust Reference Implementation,
demonstrating interoperability across different systems without the need
to develop inter-system connectivity protocols such as APIs. It also established
the interoperability between digital and paper-based processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VLK was supported by their Protection and Indemnity (P&amp;I) Club, on
the basis that the P&amp;I liabilities arising from the use of a TradeTrust-issued
eBL is equivalent to the liabilities that could have arisen under the use
of a paper-based Bill of Lading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The eBL was legally supported solely by statutory law without the use
of any contract law or rulebook. This shipment showed that an eBL issued
using the TradeTrust framework can be used in a non-MLETR jurisdiction,
such as Thailand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why it matters, digitalising the Future of Global Trade</strong>
</p>
<p>The introduction of eBLs has enabled greater efficiency by streamlining
and automating existing processes. The benefits include shorter waiting
times and reduced costs. This pilot builds on cooperation with industry
partners like ExxonMobil to encourage the use of ETRs and facilitate cross-border
trade. Using the TradeTrust framework, ETRs can be issued, transferred,
and surrendered between multiple stakeholders in a trusted manner, across
different digital platforms, which is necessary in the context of cross-border
trade.</p>
<p>“Since 2019, Singapore has looked to reshape, reimagine, and redefine
the way the world trades. International trade ecosystem is heavily reliant
on physical paper documents and signatures for validation. This live transaction
for consignment of liquid chemical from Singapore to Thailand, leverages
on the TradeTrust framework to create an eBL that uses UNCITRAL’s MLETR
compliant statutory law framework. More importantly, we are excited to
have demonstrated that the industry can potentially use eBL even if there
was no basis of a contractual legal framework. We believe this will illuminate
wider adoption of eBL in cross-border trade,” said Mr Loh Sin Yong, Director,
TradeTrust, IMDA.</p>
<p>“This pilot is part of ExxonMobil’s efforts to increase our supply chain
resiliency through digitalisation of business processes. We welcome frameworks
like TradeTrust as an important part of our journey towards digitalization.
Such frameworks increase efficiency and cost savings while maintaining
high standards and trust, and we hope that this successful trial will lead
to increased interest from industry to adopt similar standards,” said Mr
Low Say Lim, Asia Pacific Liquids Logistics &amp; Distribution Manager,
ExxonMobil Asia Pacific.</p>
