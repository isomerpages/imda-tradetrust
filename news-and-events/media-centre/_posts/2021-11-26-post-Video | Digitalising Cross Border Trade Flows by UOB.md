<p>We are pleased to lead IMDA’s pilot on digitalising cross-border trade
flows between Singapore and China using the blockchain framework, TradeTrust.
With this, businesses can transfer electronic bills of lading and other
trade documents across the ecosystem and the trade finance cycle fast and
seamlessly, enabling greater efficiencies and cost savings. In the pilot,
our Singapore and Shenzhen clients saw the processing turnaround time reduced
from a few days to within an hour!</p>
<p>“Being at the forefront of connecting ASEAN with Greater China, UOB is
pleased to be part of IMDA’s TradeTrust digital utility that transforms
conventional cross-border trade flows for greater efficiencies. We look
forward to working with our clients from across the region to enhance their
cross-border trade efficiency and to optimise their working capital with
greater digital connectivity.” – <em>Lay Hua So, Head of Group Transaction Banking, UOB</em>.
