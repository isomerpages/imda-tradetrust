<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why is Trade Digitalisation important to you?</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trade digitalisation streamlines cross-border trade by replacing cumbersome
paper-based processes with efficient, MLETR-compliant digital solutions.
This shift reduces operational costs and transaction times and enhances
security and compliance. Moreover, it fosters financial inclusion by enabling
new companies to participate in global trade with alternative financing
options, even without established trade or credit history.</p>
<p>Credore's blockchain-backed platform ensures transparency, trust, and
adherence to global standards and sustainability goals. Ultimately, trade
digitalisation empowers Credore to scale its operations, onboard diverse
stakeholders, and realise its vision of reducing cash flow cycles to zero,
thereby making global trade processes better, faster and more efficient.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What are some of the benefits of using TradeTrust for Credore’s ecosystem?</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TradeTrust reduced courier and document handling costs by 50% to 80% and
expedited document processing from days to mere minutes. This efficiency
translates to faster cargo access and financing. TradeTrust's blockchain-based
system also ensures tamper-proof documentation, helps us mitigate fraud
risks, and reduces potential disputes. The system’s interoperability attracts
a wider range of stakeholders, fostering greater adoption of Credore's
ecosystem. These advantages collectively enhance efficiency, trust, and
scalability, and establish Credore's ecosystem as a robust solution for
global trade digitalisation.</p>

<p>ASTRON is a Digital Trust Infrastructure (DTI) designed to foster cross-border
trust, enable secure collaboration, and drive global innovation in today’s
hyper-connected world.</p>
<p>Born from the need to navigate the complexities of digital connectivity,
