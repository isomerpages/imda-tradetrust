<p>Singapore Trade Data Exchange (SGTraDex) is a digital utility designed
to streamline supply chain information flows through a secure, common data
highway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>With IGP&amp;I’s deemed approval for SGTraDex recently, how do you see this strengthening trust and interoperability across the trade ecosystem, and what new opportunities does it unlock for digital trade?</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"The approval from IGP&amp;I for our Electronic Bills of Lading (eBL)
solution is an important milestone for SGTraDex. By ensuring our eBLs carry
the same legal and insurance “weight” as paper-based documents, we have
effectively bridged the “insurance gap” that has long hindered the adoption
of digital trade.</p>
<p>Navigating the rigorous IGP&amp;I approval process was a rewarding challenge
that allowed us to stress-test our infrastructure against global standards.
This wasn’t just about technical compliance; it was about ensuring our
digital highway is robust enough for international waters. This validation
strengthens trust across the ecosystem, signalling to global shipping lines
and financial institutions that SGTraDex is a secure, interoperable partner.</p>
<p>We are now positioned to scale rapidly, transforming eBLs from a niche
alternative into the industry standard, significantly reducing the world’s
reliance on paper-based trade documents."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>From your perspective, what role does SGTraDex play in accelerating trade digitalisation, and how can TradeTrust and SGTraDex work together to drive greater adoption across industries?</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"The best analogy for our role in digital trade is to see SGTraDex as
a data exchange “highway” and TradeTrust as the “traffic rules” that dictates
how traffic moves. While TradeTrust provides the legal and technical framework
based on UNCITRAL MLETR standards, SGTraDex provides the neutral, secure
infrastructure for the end-to-end exchange of these digital assets.</p>
<p>We are not just talking about potential use cases but delivering real-world
impact. Our recent collaboration with TradeTrust netted us Singapore Business
Federation’s Pro-Enterprise Impact &amp; Partnership Award. With the launch
of the world’s first live interoperable digital “Documents against Payment”
(D/P) solution, we demonstrated that our highway works across borders and
diverse digital infrastructures.</p>
<p>The results were tangible: reduced shipment to payment cycle from 20 days
to just 5 days, cut documentation handling time by 60% and helped banks
reduce document circulation costs by 30%. For our customers, this isn’t
just about a new feature but also being part of a proven, award-winning
partnership that has levelled the playing field and is now scaling into
new territories."</p>
