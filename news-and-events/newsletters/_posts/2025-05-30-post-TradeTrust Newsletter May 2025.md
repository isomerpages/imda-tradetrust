<blockquote>
<p><strong>How has using TradeTrust changed the way you handle trade documentation, and what benefits have you seen in terms of transaction speed and transparency?</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Using TradeTrust has significantly transformed the way we handle trade
documentation. By transitioning to electronic bills of lading (eBL), we’ve
moved away from the cumbersome paper-based processes. One of the biggest
benefits we’ve seen is the increased speed of transactions, allowing documentation
to be completed in hours instead of weeks. We no longer need to wait for
physical documents to be couriered, which has significantly reduced the
time taken. The digital system also allows for enhanced transparency as
we have real-time access to shipment data, thus improving visibility across
our entire supply chain. This level of visibility also reduces the chances
of errors, fraud, or disputes, making the entire trading process more reliable
and transparent."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What are the key factors that would encourage wider adoption of digital trade documents among traders?</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For wider adoption of digital trade documents like eBLs, it's essential
to create a comprehensive ecosystem where all stakeholders — vendors, suppliers,
customers, banks, and shipping lines — actively participate. This collaborative
framework ensures trust and standardised processes. Since adoption is currently
limited, educating and incentivising relevant parties is crucial, along
with regulatory support and industry-wide initiatives that promote electronic
alternatives to paper-based Bill of Ladings.</p>

<h4><strong>Latest TradeTrust-enabled Transaction:</strong><br><strong>A Seamless, Cryptoless Digital Transaction between China and Singapore</strong></h4>
<p>Enabled by TradeTrust, COFCO and Yit Hong successfully completed the world’s
first interoperable digital Documents against Payment (D/P) transaction
using electronic Bills of Lading (eBLs). Supported by major banks including
BOC, ICBC, DBS, and UOB, alongside carriers PIL and digital platforms AEOTrade
and SGTraDex, this live transaction reduced document processing from weeks
to minutes, enhancing security and efficiency in cross-border trade between
China and Singapore.</p>
<p>This project marks another achievement in Beijing-Singapore digital economy
collaboration, introducing a novel interoperable trade finance model for
international trade and financial services, paving the way for business-as-usual
digital operations.</p><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://www.tradetrust.io/beijing-and-singapore-launch-interoperable-digital-documents-against-payment-trade-corporation/"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="COFCO-Yit Hong Case Study" src="/images/TradeTrust_DP_v5_ENG.jpg"></a>

<p>As global trade continues to digitise, the move from paper-based processes
to electronic transferable trade documentation requires a robust legal
framework to ensure trust, security, and interoperability across platforms.
One key milestone in this journey is the development of the TradeTrust
Model Terms, a set of model legal provisions designed to support the use
of Electronic Transferable Records (ETRs) such as electronic Bills of Lading
(eBLs). The TradeTrust Model Terms serve as an essential complement to
the technical framework, helping ensure the legal effectiveness of digital
documents across jurisdictions.</p>
<h4><strong>Collaboration with Legal Experts</strong></h4>
<p>IMDA engaged Watson Farley &amp; Williams LLP (WFW)—a global law firm
with deep expertise in maritime and trade law—to develop the TradeTrust
Model Terms and Guidance Notes. These resources are tailored primarily
for TradeTrust eBL adopters such as Business Service Providers (BSPs) and
System Owners, but the legal structure and principles can also be adapted
to support other ETRs, including:</p>
