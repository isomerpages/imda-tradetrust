</div>
<p>Since 2021, UOB has been working in close collaboration with IMDA’s TradeTrust
to pioneer and advance the adoption of electronic Bills of Lading (eBL)
within the trade finance sector.</p>
<p>Through the successful completion of live eBL transaction, UOB has demonstrated
the interoperability of multiple digital platforms used by ecosystem players
in Singapore and China. This milestone highlights the benefits of enhanced
speed and security for the cross-border trade transaction. Through its
ongoing collaboration with TradeTrust, UOB aims to support the development
of digital trade and contribute towards the industry’s movement on eBL
adoption.</p>
<p>In this edition, we hear from Ms Ng Poh Yee, Head of Trade and Financial
Supply Chain Management Sales at UOB, about the significance of digital
transformation in trade finance and the path forward for increased adoption
of digital trade:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Given your experience with the Digital Documents against Payment (D/P) Trial, how do you assess TradeTrust’s potential to enhance global trade security, migrate fraud risks and improve efficiency in global trade?</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"The digital issuance and transfer of eBLs allow banks to efficiently
verify the authenticity of documents without the need for separate validation
procedures. When scaled, this capability boosts operational efficiency,
reduce the risk of trade finance fraud, and enhance confidence in cross-border
transactions. Additionally, ecosystem participants can now view, validate,
and transfer title to goods almost instantaneously, enabling greater speed,
transparency, and trust in global trade.</p>
<p>eBLs have facilitated fully digital D/P transactions, reducing the end-to-end
processing time for documentary collections, from seller and remitting
bank to collecting bank and buyer, from five working days to the same day."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>As TradeTrust continues to shape the future of digital trade, how can collaborations between financial institutions, governments, and tech providers accelerate the adoption of interoperable eBLs?</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Collectively, we are taking steps in the right direction towards increasing
adoption of digital trade. Government-to-government collaboration, such
as the case of this D/P trial between Singapore and China, plays a key
role in aligning ecosystem stakeholders and promoting the development of
regulatory and legal frameworks needed to support the widespread adoption
of digital trade. Cross-sector partnerships are especially vital. Projects
that bring together financial institutions, governments, and technology
providers are essential for driving seamless adoption of interoperable
eBLs, ultimately accelerating the global transition to digital trade."</p>

</div>
<p>We are proud to announce that ASTRON Network’s case, “Building Global
Cross-Border Digital Trust Bridges, Co-Creating an Open and Trusted Digital
Ecosystem,” was selected as an exemplary case in the Network Infrastructure
Construction category at the 2025 World Internet Conference Wuzhen Summit.
The case was presented during the “Release and Presentation of Outstanding
Cases of Jointly Building a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace”
ceremony, showcasing twelve outstanding initiatives from over 300 submissions.</p>
<p>ASTRON is a crypto-less EVM compatible Layer-2 public blockchain variant
developed by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology
(CAICT) to support Chinese international trading. In the Digital Documents
against Payment (D/P) project, ASTRON highlighted its collaboration with
TradeTrust, demonstrating how the use of trusted electronic trade documents
across different platforms can advance global trade. This project showcased
how TradeTrust’s interoperability and secure framework, enabled by public
blockchain technology, helped ASTRON advance cross-border digital trade.</p>
<p>TradeTrust relies on public blockchain technology, enabled by Ethereum,
Polygon, XDC, ASTRON (crypto-less), and STABILITY (crypto-less), to electronically
endorse and transfer ownership of documents among stakeholders along a
trade flow. Public blockchains allow for an open and interoperable system,
enabling all international parties to participate.</p>

<p>Li Haihua, Deputy Head of the Informatisation and Institute for Industrial
Internet &amp; Internet of Things (IIIIoT) at the CAICT, noted TradeTrust’s
involvement in the project, stating, “The successful collaboration between
the ASTRON Network and TradeTrust is a prime example of building an open
and trusted digital ecosystem. By enabling the digital transmission and
mutual recognition of trade documents through blockchain technology, the
partnership has significantly enhanced the efficiency and security of cross-border
trade, while providing a replicable pathway for developing an open and
trusted digital environment.”</p>
<p>We are incredibly proud to have been part of this milestone with ASTRON
and look forward to furthering the impact of digital trust in the global
trade community.</p>

</div>
<p>The digital trade ecosystem has long struggled with fragmented systems
that hinder the widespread adoption of electronic Bills of Lading (eBLs).
With only 5% of the 45 million Bills of Lading issued each year being electronic,
the promise of seamless, global digital trade remains largely unfulfilled.
The root cause? A lack of interoperability across proprietary eBL platforms,
where each system operates as a closed ecosystem.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Breaking through the eBL silos in digital trade" src="/images/05_Article4_2Image.png">
</div>
<p>In our latest thought leadership piece, we explore why interoperability
is the critical missing link for scaling eBL adoption. We examine current
industry efforts, including standardisation and bilateral platform partnerships,
and highlight how the lack of a common "highway" between platforms has
kept eBLs from reaching their full potential.</p>
<p>As the digital trade landscape evolves, understanding these interoperability
challenges is crucial to navigating the future of global trade.</p><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://www.tradetrust.io/break-the-ebl-silos-why-interoperability-is-the-missing-link-in-digital-trade/"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Read the full article" src="/images/05_Article4_3_CTA.png"></a>

cross-platform interoperability.</p>
