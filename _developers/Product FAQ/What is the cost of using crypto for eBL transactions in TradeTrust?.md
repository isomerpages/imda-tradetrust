<p>Currently, TradeTrust can be connected to a few public blockchain networks:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Ethereum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P﻿olygon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XinFin (XDC) Network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stability (non-cryptocurrency network)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are the estimated fees (USD) computed as at 2 Feb 2023 for a typical
series of NFT transactions related to an electronic Bill of Lading (eBL),
from its issuance to surrender:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Estimated Fees on Ethereum: &lt; USD $20</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E﻿stimated Fees on Polygon: &lt; USD $0.16</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do note that the cost estimated above involves the whole chain of endorsements
(NFT transactions) for a transferable document like eBL. This cost is expected
to be shared across multiple transaction parties in the eBL value chain.</p>
