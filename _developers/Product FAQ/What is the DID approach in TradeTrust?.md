<p>The DID is currently only applicable for normal/verifiable documents.
By using the DID approach, the issuance of normal/verifiable documents
will not incur any gas fee.</p>
<p>However, revocation of the issued docs will require the setup of document
store and hence will incur gas fee. See <a href="https://docs.tradetrust.io/docs/advanced/aws-kms/did-sign-demo" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">DID detail.</a>
