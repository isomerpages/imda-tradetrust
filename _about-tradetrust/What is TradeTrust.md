<summary><strong>Why is public blockchains used?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>TradeTrust utilizes public Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology
to demonstrate provenance, essential for the legitimacy of documents such
as Bills of Lading. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are used to ensure the singularity
of the record for transferable documents, with blockchain recording the
NFT transactions to electronically endorse and transfer the ownership of
a document among stakeholders along a trade flow. This choice was deliberate
to <strong>eliminate the need for a central authority</strong> or body to
govern the network and gatekeep participation, allowing for an open and
interoperable system for all international parties to participate seamlessly.</p>
