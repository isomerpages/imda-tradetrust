<p>Yes, TradeTrust is designed to be compliant with Singapore’s Electronic
Transactions Act (ETA), which has been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">harmonised</a> 
<a href="#_msocom_1" class="msocomanchor" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[RY1]</a>&nbsp; with other global jurisdictions that also adopt the UNCITRAL
MLETR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TradeTrust is built on four key elements.</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Legal Harmonisation</strong>
<br>In 2021, Singapore updated its laws to legally recognise electronic trade
documents that follow international standards, the UNCITRAL MLETR. TradeTrust
documents that comply with UNCITRAL MLETR are legally valid across borders.
There is no need for separate legal contracts or rulebooks.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Global Standards</strong>
<br>TradeTrust works with international standards bodies like the UN/CEFACT,
ISO and UNESCAP. Adopting TradeTrust means following internationally recognised
standards and accreditation.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accreditation&nbsp;</strong>
<br>Technical solutions are certified to meet legal requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Software Components</strong>
<br>TradeTrust’s software components are free and open-source for easy integration
into existing systems. It acts as a middleware that can be plugged into
different blockchains. This means you can ensure the authenticity, verify
the source, and validate the legal transfer of trade obligations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data is kept confidential at all times as it is not stored on the blockchain.
In addition, various data formats are supported. In 2021, TradeTrust underwent
a security assessment by Ernst &amp; Young to ensure that the framework
is reliable and trustworthy.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In essence, TradeTrust provides a legally harmonised, globally standardised,
and secure framework for digital trade documentation, backed by open-source
software components that can be easily integrated into existing systems.</p>
