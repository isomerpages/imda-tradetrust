<p>TradeTrust can support <strong>all</strong> digital documents.</p>
<p>TradeTrust can be utilised to digitalise two categories of documents used
in cross-border trade:</p>
<p><strong>Normal documents/Verifiable documents</strong> such as the Certificate
of Origin where the provenance and authenticity of the e-document can be
easily verified by any party;</p>
<p><strong>Transferable Documents</strong> such as Bill of Lading where the
e-documentâ€™s title ownership can be transferred from one party to another.</p>
