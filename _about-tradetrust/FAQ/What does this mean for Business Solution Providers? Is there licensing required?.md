<p>Business Solution Providers (including SGTraDex) which have integrated
TradeTrust to provide digital services dealing with electronic transferable
records such as eBLs will typically manage the cryptocurrencies required
to pay their clientsâ€™ recording of their NFT transactions.</p>
<p>For such payments, the TradeTrust team has consulted the Monetary Authority
of Singapore's (MAS) regulatory team on the need for licensing requirement.
MAS has advised that if the Business Solution Providers are not facilitating
buying and selling of digital payment tokens (DPT) and arranging the transmission
of DPTs from one account to another, they would not be deemed to be carrying
on a business of providing a DPT service under the Payment Services Act
2019.</p>
<p>MAS further recommends that Business Solution Providers conduct their
own legal and compliance review before proceeding</p>
