integrate the software into your system.</p>
<p>For enquiries, write to us at <a href="https://www.github.com/TradeTrust" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">tradetrust@imda.gov.sg</a> or fill

<p>Alternatively, businesses can engage the services from any of the TradeTrust
enabled platform/service providers to commence their live transactions
or help integrate TradeTrust into any existing system of businesses.</p>
<p>TradeTrust is not a platform, is not a competitor to existing platforms.
Instead, TradeTrust provides a solution to the current lack of technical
interoperability in the market by enabling any party to issue its own TradeTrust-enabled
Electronic Transferable Records (ETRs) like Bills of Lading; outside of
the confines of any contract-based platform.</p>
