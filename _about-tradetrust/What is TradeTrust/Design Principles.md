<h4>5 Design Principles of TradeTrust</h4><p><strong>Public Blockchain</strong></p><p><em>No central governance authority</em></p><p>Leveraging on the strength of its immutability and security of cutting-edge technologies like Blockchain, Smart Contracts and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), TradeTrust enables a fully decentralised approach to manage the transactions of electronic Bill of Ladings (eBLs) from their issuance to surrender, eliminating the need for all transacting parties of the same eBL to use a common digital platform. TradeTrust also uses Decentralised Identifiers (DID), digital signatures and cryptographic proof methods to verify the source and authenticity of documents.</p><p></p><p><strong>Data Off-Chain</strong></p><p><em>Preserves data confidentiality</em></p><p>Your data is not kept on the blockchain to preserve the data confidentiality.</p><p></p><p><strong>Payload Agnostic</strong></p><p><em>No data format or standard restriction</em></p><p>Your current data/document format will be supported since TradeTrust is payload agnostic with no data format restriction </p><p><strong>Open-Source</strong></p><p><em>Full transparency for faster adoption</em></p><p>TradeTrust software components are distributed open-source so that participants (both government and private-sector) can assure themselves of what the software code does. The software components aim to simplify your technical integration work.</p><p></p><p><strong>MLETR^-Compliant</strong></p><p><em>Meet the requirements of the law (for electronic negotiable documents)</em></p><p>This provides legal certainty to electronic title/transferable documents like your e-Bill of Lading.</p><p></p>
