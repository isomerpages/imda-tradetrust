<h4>5 Design Principles of TradeTrust</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Public Blockchain</strong> 
<br><em>No central governance authority</em> 
<br>
</p>
<p>Leveraging on the strength of its immutability and security of cutting-edge
technologies like Blockchain, Smart Contracts and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs),
TradeTrust enables a fully decentralised approach to manage the transactions
of electronic Bill of Ladings (eBLs) from their issuance to surrender,
eliminating the need for all transacting parties of the same eBL to use
a common digital platform. TradeTrust also uses Decentralised Identifiers
(DID), digital signatures and cryptographic proof methods to verify the
source and authenticity of documents.</p>
<p>You are free to choose any of the 4 blockchains - Ethereum, Polygon, XDC,
Stability to transact TradeTrust-issued documents.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Data Off-Chain</strong> 
<br><em>Preserves data confidentiality</em>
</p>
<p>Your data is not kept on the blockchain to preserve the data confidentiality.
When a document is issued using TradeTrust, a TradeTrust file (with .TT
file extension for example) is created. Your date is stored in the TradeTrust
file, which then can be transmitted to your trading partner(s) through
any of your existing transmission protocol like email, FTP, server to server
API calls etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Payload Agnostic</strong> 
<br><em>No data format or standard restriction</em>
</p>
<p>Your current data or document formats of any document will be supported
since TradeTrust is payload agnostic with no data format restriction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="4" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Open-Source</strong> 
<br><em>Full transparency for faster adoption</em> 
<br>TradeTrust software components are distributed open-source so that participants
(both government and private-sector) can assure themselves of what the
software code does. The software components aim to simplify your technical
integration work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="5" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>MLETR*-Compliant</strong> 
<br><em>Meet the requirements of the law (for electronic negotiable documents)</em> 
<br>TradeTrust enables the digitalisation of electronic documents that is
intended to be legally equivalent to their paper-based counterparts under
Singapore and other MLETR-compliant statutory law. This provides legal
certainty to electronic title/transferable documents like your e-Bills
of Lading.</p>
</li>
</ol>
