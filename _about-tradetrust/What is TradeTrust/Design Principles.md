<h3><strong>5 Design Principles of TradeTrust</strong></h3>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Public Blockchain - </strong>
<br><em>No central governance authority</em> 
<br>
</p>
<p>TradeTrust uses secure technologies (blockchain, smart contracts, non-fungible
tokens or NFTs) to manage electronic trade documents without need for a
central authority.</p>
<p>TradeTrust also uses Decentralised Identifiers (DID), digital signatures
and cryptographic proof methods to verify the source and authenticity of
documents.</p>
<p>You can choose any of the four blockchains—Ethereum, Polygon, XDC, or
Stability—to transact TradeTrust-enabled documents.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Off-Chain</strong> - <em>Preserves data confidentiality</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your data stays private by being stored separately and shared through
traditional methods like email. When a document is issued using TradeTrust,
a TradeTrust file (with a .TT file extension, for example <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">filename.tt</a>)
is created. Your data is stored in the TradeTrust file, which can be sent
to your trading partner(s) through email, FTP, server-to-server API calls,
etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Payload Agnostic</strong> - <em>No data format or standard restriction</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is no restriction on the type of data or format. TradeTrust works
for ALL types of digital documents.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="4" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Open-Source</strong> - <em>Full transparency for faster adoption</em> 
<br>TradeTrust distributes its software as open-source, making it easier for
everyone in the public sector to understand and use. It also enables full
transparency for easy integration and implementation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="5" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>MLETR*-Compliant</strong> 
<br>TradeTrust ensures that digital documents meet legal standards set out
by MLETR, providing authenticity and certainty for documents like eBLs.
<br>
<br>*<em>MLETR = Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records published by United Nations Commission on International Trade Law in Sept 2017</em>
