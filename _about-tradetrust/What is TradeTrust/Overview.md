<h4>ONE Framework for Trade Digitalisation</h4>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>TradeTrust is a<strong> </strong>framework<strong> </strong>for anyone
to embark on trade digitalisation to address difficulties with the exchange
and processing of digital trade documentation using pre-built digital utility
easily and for free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s like providing you with a supporting structure and free tool, to
turn your documents into smart electronic documents with enhanced security
features that are portable across your trading partners. Intended recipients
can verify documents’ proof of origin and authenticity as well as transfer
of ownership independently, legally and in compliance with globally-accepted
standards. All from the convenience of your enhanced IT system that you
are familiar with, or simply with an internet access.</p>
<p>TradeTrust supports the digitalisation of trade documents, with no data
format or standard restriction, into two document types :
<br>(1) <strong>Verifiable Documents </strong>for example certificates of origin
and packing lists; and
<br>(2) <strong>Transferable Documents</strong> for example Electronic Transferable
Records (ETRs) such as electronic Bills of Lading and warehouse receipts</p>
<p>The outputs are TradeTrust-enabled documents known as <strong>TrustDoc files</strong> which
are portable and effective across systems. Thereby, enabling a fully <strong>decentralised approach</strong> to
manage business transactions, eliminating the need for you and all your
transacting parties to use a common digital platform and contractual rulebook.</p>
<p>TradeTrust provides three key functionalities. TradeTrust uses verifiable
credentials technical methods to enable end users to verify the authenticity
and provenance of documents, and blockchain technology to effect title
transfer in accordance with statutory law.</p>
