<h4>TradeTrust is ONE framework</h4><p>At the heart of international trade, <strong>TradeTrust</strong>, <strong>a framework</strong> developed and pioneered by<strong> Singaporeâ€™s Infocomm Media Development Authority</strong> (IMDA), is designed to make trade easier and more secure for businesses like yours. By reducing the costs and risks associated with paper-based documentation,<strong> </strong>TradeTrust connects governments and businesses to a public blockchain, ensuring<strong> trusted interoperability</strong> of electronic trade documents <strong>across digital platforms</strong>.</p><p>TradeTrust is also a <strong>digital utility </strong>that's accessible to businesses of all sizes. With its open-source code available for free, integrating TradeTrust into your existing systems is easy, driving the digital transformation of your trade processes.</p><h4>For TWO document types : Verifiable Documents and Transferable Documents</h4><p>By leveraging international standards and frameworks, you can use TradeTrust for the digitalisation of trade documents into two broad categories: <strong>Verifiable Documents </strong>and <strong>Transferable Documents </strong>into Electronic Transferable Records (ETRs) using blockchain technology. To transact, businesses need not rely on a contractual legal framework for title transfer since TradeTrust enables the digitalisation of<strong> electronic documents that is intended to be legally equivalent to their paper-based counterparts</strong> under Singapore and other MLETR*-compliant statutory law.</p><h4>Support THREE key functionalities</h4><p>TradeTrust empowers anyone to seamlessly<strong> verify the (1) authenticity and (2) provenance of documents</strong>, facilitating smooth <strong>(3) title transfers</strong> of<strong> </strong>transferable documents across digital platforms. This means achieving end-to-end digital processing of trade documents, making international trade more efficient and secure for you and your trading partners.</p><p>TradeTrust enables a fully <strong>decentralised approach</strong> to manage business transactions, eliminating the need for all transacting parties to use a common digital platform.</p><h4>How to start using TradeTrust</h4><p><strong>Anyone can implement using TradeTrust's framework including the freely available source code</strong>. Alternatively, you can engage the services from any of the TradeTrust enabled platform/solution service providers to commence their live transactions or implementation work.</p><p></p><p>*<em>MLETR = Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records published by United Nations Commission on International Trade Law in Sept 2017</em></p><p></p>
