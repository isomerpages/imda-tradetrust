<h4><strong><u>One Framework for Trade Digitalisation</u></strong></h4>
<p>TradeTrust is a system that uses global standards to link governments
and businesses to a public blockchain. This allows electronic trade documents,
such as the Bill of Lading (BL), to be trusted and easily exchanged across
different digital platforms.</p>
<p>At present, international trade remains heavily reliant on paper documents
to facilitate the trade process. Documentation for a <strong>single shipment may involve up to 50 sheets of paper</strong>.
This not only makes the trade process <strong>susceptible to fraud</strong> and
inefficiency, but also extremely <strong>costly</strong>, <strong>accounting for up to 20 percent of the shipping cost</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With TradeTrust, you can create and manage digital trade documents, such
as electronic bills of lading (eBLs), that are transferable and legally
equivalent to physical documents. This reduces the processing time significantly: <strong>Paperwork that used to take five to 10 days to process can now be accomplished in 24 hours</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result of going digital, the <strong>shipping ecosystem stands to benefit from US$6.5 billion</strong> in
cost savings.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Easy to Use and Implement</u></strong></h4>
<p>TradeTrust is open-source, with no standard format or restrictions to
hinder implementation. Your trading partners will be able to integrate
the framework into their systems quickly and seamlessly. Furthermore, all
parties involved will be able to endorse, exchange and verify the authenticity
and source of documents. They can then transfer titles seamlessly across
different digital platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>Decentralised Access</u></strong></h4>
<p>TradeTrust manages trade documents like eBLs, from end-to-end using a
public blockchain. The decentralised nature of a public blockchain – meaning
that there is no single governing authority – makes it the most accessible
and neutral way to record transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>Secure and Confidential</u></strong></h4>
<p>To preserve confidentiality, no data is stored on the blockchain. Relevant
parties, such as a port authority or freight forwarder, may only access
the data through a sophisticated authentication system.&nbsp;</p>
