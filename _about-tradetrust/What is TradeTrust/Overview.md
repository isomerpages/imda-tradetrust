<h3><strong><u>One Framework for Trade Digitalisation</u></strong></h3>
<p>Developed and pioneered by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA),
TradeTrust was designed to transforms your trade digitalisation journey.</p>
<p><strong>TradeTrust is framework that standardizes digital trade with enhanced security and legal certainty for international trade ecosystem.</strong> It
achieves this by using advanced technologies and adhering to global standards
and legal requirements to enable trusted interoperability of electronic
trade documents across digital platforms. Electronic documents issued this
way can be trusted, portable, and legally effective on different systems,
thereby streamlining cross-platform compatibility and enhancing overall
operational efficiency for businesses and governments.</p>
<p>And offered as a free digital utility, it is open-sourced so that all
parties can easily adopt for free and build upon it to benefit the business
ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s like providing you with a supporting structure and free tool, to
turn your documents into smart electronic documents that are portable across
your trading partners with enhanced security features and meeting standards
and legal requirements.</p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Users can independently verify documents’ proof of origin and authenticity
as well as transfer titles. All from the convenience of your enhanced IT
system that you are familiar with, or simply with an internet access just
to verify documents.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>TWO Document Types : Verifiable Documents and Transferable Documents</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;With TradeTrust, you can digitise any business documents, with no
data format or standard restriction, into two document types:</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;<strong>Verifiable Documents&nbsp;</strong>for example certificates
of origin and packing lists; and
<br>(2)&nbsp;<strong>Transferable Documents</strong>&nbsp;for example Electronic
Transferable Records (ETRs) such as electronic Bills of Lading and warehouse
receipts</p>
<p>&nbsp;With TradeTrust designed to be compliant with <strong><a href="https://www.tradetrust.io/static/images/legality/Stephenson_Harwood_Article_on_TradeTrust_eBLs.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR)</a></strong>,&nbsp;you
can create and manage transferable documents, such as electronic bills
of lading (eBLs), that are transferable and legally equivalent to physical
documents. This reduces the risks of fraud and the processing time significantly: <strong>Paperwork that used to take five to 10 days to process can now be accomplished in 24 hours</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
