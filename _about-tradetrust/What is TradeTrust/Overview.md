<h4>ONE Framework for Trade Digitalisation</h4>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>TradeTrust is a<strong> </strong>framework<strong> </strong>for anyone
to embark on trade digitalisation to address difficulties with the exchange
and processing of digital trade documentation using pre-built digital utility
easily and for free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s like providing you with a s<strong>upporting structure and free tool</strong>,
to turn your documents into smart electronic documents with <strong>enhanced security features</strong> that
are <strong>portable</strong> across your trading partners. Intended recipients
can verify documents’ <strong>proof of origin</strong> and <strong>authenticity</strong> as
well as <strong>transfer of ownership</strong>  <strong>independently</strong>, <strong>legally</strong> and
in <strong>compliance</strong> with globally-accepted standards. All from
the convenience of your enhanced IT system that you are familiar with,
or simply with an internet access just to verify documents.</p>
<p>TradeTrust supports the digitalisation of trade documents, with no data
format or standard restriction, into two document types :
<br>(1) <strong>Verifiable Documents </strong>for example certificates of origin
and packing lists; and
<br>(2) <strong>Transferable Documents</strong> for example Electronic Transferable
Records (ETRs) such as electronic Bills of Lading and warehouse receipts</p>
<p>The outputs are TradeTrust-enabled documents known as <strong>TrustDoc files</strong> which
are portable and effective across systems. Thereby, enabling a fully <strong>decentralised approach</strong> to
manage business transactions, eliminating the need for you and all your
transacting parties to use a common digital platform and contractual rulebook.</p>
<p>TradeTrust provides three key functionalities. TradeTrust uses verifiable
credentials technical methods to enable end users to verify the authenticity
and provenance of documents, and blockchain technology to effect title
transfer in accordance with statutory law.</p>
<p>And offered as a digital utility, the open-source code is available for
free download with guided integration into your existing IT system. Or

<h5>Is my data and transaction safe?</h5>

data confidentiality. Only the title ownership is recorded on any one of
the blockchain(Ethereum, Polygon, XDC or Stability) for title documents.

TradeTrust's security assessment was conducted comprehensively by a third-party
- Ernst &amp; Young.</p>
