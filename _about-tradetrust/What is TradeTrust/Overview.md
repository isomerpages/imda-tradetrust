<h3><strong><u>One Framework for Trade Digitalisation</u></strong></h3>
<p>TradeTrust is a framework that uses global standards to link governments
and businesses to a public blockchain to enable <strong>trusted interoperability </strong>of
electronic trade documents <strong>across digital platforms</strong>. Offered
as a free digital utility, electronic trade documents issued this waycan
be trusted, portable and legally effective across different systems.</p>
<p>It’s like providing you with a supporting structure and free tool, to
turn your documents into smart electronic documents with enhanced security
features that are portable across your trading partners. Recipients can
verify documents’ proof of origin and authenticity as well as transfer
of title independently, legally and in compliance with globally-accepted
standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At present, international trade relies heavily on paper documents to facilitate
the trade process. Documentation for a <strong>single shipment may involve up to 50 sheets of paper</strong>.
This not only makes the trade process <strong>susceptible to fraud</strong> and
inefficiency but also extremely <strong>costly</strong>, <strong>accounting for up to 20 per cent of the shipping cost</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With TradeTrust designed to be compliant with <strong><a href="https://www.tradetrust.io/static/images/legality/Stephenson_Harwood_Article_on_TradeTrust_eBLs.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR)</a></strong>,&nbsp;you
can create and manage digital trade documents, such as electronic bills
of lading (eBLs), that are transferable and legally equivalent to physical
documents. This reduces the risks of fraud and the processing time significantly: <strong>Paperwork that used to take five to 10 days to process can now be accomplished in 24 hours</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><u>Easy to Use and Implement</u></h4>
<p>TradeTrust is open-source and available for free download, with no data
format or standard restrictions to hinder implementation. &nbsp;You and
your trading partners can integrate TradeTrust into your systems quickly
or subscribe to the services offered by TradeTrust enabled partners to
start your live transactions. . All parties will be able to issue, endorse,
exchange, and verify the authenticity and source of documents. As well
as transfer titles across different trading parties digitally for negotiable/title
documents. All from the convenience of your enhanced IT system that you
are familiar with, or simply with an internet access just to verify documents.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Decentralised Approach</u></strong></h4>
<p>TradeTrust manages trade documents such as eBLs, from end-to-end using
a public blockchain. The decentralised nature of a public blockchain –
meaning that there is no single governing authority – makes it the most
accessible and neutral way to record transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you and your trading partners uniformly adopt TradeTrust in a decentralised
approach to manage business transactions, it accelerates the digitalisation
of end-to-end processing of trade documentation and eliminates the need
for all parties to use a common digital platform and contractual rulebook.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Secure and Confidential</u></strong></h4>
<p>No data is stored on the blockchain to preserve confidentiality. .</p>
<p>TradeTrust leverages verifiable credentials technical methods to enable
you to verify the authenticity and provenance of documents, and blockchain
technology to effect title transfer in accordance with statutory law.&nbsp;
Documents issued this way are cryptographically trustworthy and can be
verified independently, providing you a peace of mind.</p>
