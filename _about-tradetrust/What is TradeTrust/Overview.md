<h4>ONE Framework for Trade Digitalisation</h4>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>TradeTrust is a<strong> </strong>framework<strong> </strong>for anyone
to embark on trade digitalisation to address difficulties with the exchange
and processing of digital trade documentation using pre-built digital utility
easily and for free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TradeTrust supports the digitalisation of trade documents, with no data
format or standard restriction, into two document types :
<br>(1) <strong>Verifiable Documents </strong>for example certificate of origin
and packing lists, and
<br>(2) <strong>Transferable Documents</strong> for example Electronic Transferable
Records (ETRs) such as electronic Bill of Lading and warehouse receipt</p>
<p>The outputs are TradeTrust-enabled documents known as <strong>TrustDoc files</strong> which
are portable and effective across systems. Thereby, enabling a fully <strong>decentralised approach</strong> to
manage business transactions, eliminating the need for you and all your
transacting parties to use a common digital platform and contractual rulebook.</p>
<p>TradeTrust provides three key functionalities. TradeTrust uses verifiable
credentials technical methods to enable end users to verify the authenticity
and provenance of documents, and blockchain technology to effect title
transfer in accordance with statutory law.</p>
<p>And offered as a digital utility, the open-source code is available for
free download with guided integration into your existing IT system. Or
