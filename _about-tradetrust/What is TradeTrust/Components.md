<h3><strong>4 Key Components of TradeTrust</strong></h3>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Legal Harmonisation</strong> 
<br>In 2021, Singapore updated its laws to recognise electronic trade documents
that follow international standards legally, the UNCITRAL MLETR. TradeTrust
documents that comply with UNCITRAL MLETR are legally valid across borders.
There is no need for separate legal contracts or rulebooks.
<br>
</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Global Standards</strong> 
<br>TradeTrust works with international standards bodies like the UN/CEFACT,
ISO and UNESCAP. Adopting TradeTrust means following internationally recognised
standards and accreditation.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accreditation&nbsp;<br></strong>Technical solutions are certified
to meet legal requirements.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Software Components</strong> 
<br>Ernst &amp; Young audited, reviewed, and assessed the TradeTrust framework
in 2021 to ensure its reliability and trustworthiness. Data is always kept
confidential, as it is not stored on the blockchain.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>TradeTrust supports many document formats. Its components are open-source
and free to use, enabling easy integration into existing systems. It functions
as middleware that can be plugged into different blockchains. This means
you can ensure authenticity, verify the source, and validate the legal
transfer of trade obligations.</p>
<p>In essence, TradeTrust provides a legally harmonised, globally standardised,
and secure framework for digital trade documentation, backed by open-source
software components that can be easily integrated into existing systems.</p>
