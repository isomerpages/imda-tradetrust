<h3><strong>4 Key Components of TradeTrust</strong></h3>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Legal Harmonisation</strong> 
<br>In 2021, Singapore updated its laws to recognise electronic trade documents
that follow international standards legally, the United Nations Commission
on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Electronic Transferable
Records (MLETR). TradeTrust-enabled documents that comply with UNCITRAL
MLETR are<strong> <a href="https://www.tradetrust.io/static/images/legality/Stephenson_Harwood_Article_on_TradeTrust_eBLs.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">legally</a></strong>&nbsp;valid
across borders. There is no need for separate legal contracts or rulebooks.
<br>
</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Global Standards</strong> 
<br>TradeTrust works with international standards bodies like the UN/CEFACT,
W3C and UNESCAP. Adopting TradeTrust means following internationally recognised
standards and accreditation.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>

<li>
<p><strong>Accreditation&nbsp;<br></strong>Technical solutions are certified
to meet legal requirements.&nbsp;
<br>

<li>
<p><strong>Software Components</strong> 
<br>The set of software components can be downloaded for free from <strong><a href="https://github.com/TradeTrust" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a></strong>&nbsp;under
the open-source licensing terms. Distributed open-source so that participants
like you (government or private-sector) can assure themselves of what the
software code does.</p>
<p>Ernst &amp; Young completed the security assessment in 2021 to ensure
its reliability and trustworthiness.</p>

<p>It functions as middleware that can be plugged into different blockchains.
This means you can ensure authenticity, verify the source, and validate
the legal transfer of trade obligations.</p>
<p>In essence, TradeTrust provides a legally harmonised, globally standardised,
and secure framework for digital trade documentation, backed by open-source
software components that can be easily integrated into existing systems.</p>
