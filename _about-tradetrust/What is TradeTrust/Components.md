<h4><strong>4 Key Components of TradeTrust</strong></h4><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Legal Harmonisation</p></li></ol><p>In March 2021, the Singaporeâ€™s Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) and other related Acts were amended to adopt with modifications the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR). This provides legal validity for electronic negotiable documents through compliance to MLETR requirements. Your TradeTrust-issued trade documents that are exchanged can be legally recognised in other jurisdictions to increase legal confidence and commercial predictability of cross-border transactions.  You can now eliminate the use of contractual legal framework/rulebook.</p><p></p><ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Standards Development</p></li></ol><p>TradeTrust works with international standards bodies like UN/CEFACT, ISO and UNESCAP to develop standards to be aligned with TradeTrust design principles.
