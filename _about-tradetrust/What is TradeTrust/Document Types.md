<h4>TWO Document Types : Verifiable Documents and Transferable Documents</h4>
<p>Your electronic documents like PDF is a snapshot of the original document
in which its proof of origin, tampering, authenticity may not be easily
verified. And they may not facilitate the transfer of title ownership for
title documents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can use TradeTrust to digitise <strong>any</strong> business documents
into two broad categories:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Normal documents/Verifiable documents</strong> such as the Certificate
of Origin where the provenance and authenticity of the e-document can be
easily verified by any party;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transferable Documents</strong> such as Bill of Lading where the
e-documentâ€™s title ownership can be transferred from one party to another.
Transferable Documents is digitised<strong> </strong>into Electronic Transferable
Records (ETRs) using blockchain technology. To transact, businesses need
not rely on a contractual legal framework for title transfer since TradeTrust
enables the digitalisation of<strong> electronic documents that is intended to be legally equivalent to their paper-based counterparts</strong> under
Singapore and other MLETR*-compliant statutory law.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Your TradeTrust-issued documents utilize the latest technical methods,
such as W3C Verifiable Credentials and ERC-721, compliant with UNCITRAL
MLETR, meeting requirements specified in various statutory laws. Now, you
can enjoy legal certainty and commercial predictability when conducting
global trade.</p>
