third_nav_title: What is TradeTrust
---
<p>There are two main types of business documents: Verifiable and Transferable.
These documents are commonly saved in digital format. It can be difficult
to prove the origin and authenticity of regular electronic documents to
facilitate the transfer of digital records of ownership of goods and titles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the TradeTrust framework, you can secure any digital document to
protect its authenticity and control the possession and actions for example
endorsement to next party, revocation..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TradeTrust-enabled documents utilise the technical methods, such as W3C
Verifiable Credentials and ERC-721, compliant with UNCITRAL MLETR, meeting
requirements specified in various statutory laws. Now, you can enjoy legal
certainty and commercial predictability when conducting global trade.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>NORMAL DOCUMENTS OR VERIFIABLE DOCUMENTS</strong></h4>
<p>These are specific trade documents that are non-transferable, such as
Certificates of Origin (CoO), Invoices, and promissory notes.</p>
<p>Without a definite framework , anyone can claim the authority to verify
and authenticate the digital documents. TradeTrust provides legal certainty
and assurance when issuing or receiving such documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Examples of how TradeTrust improves the workflow for Verifiable Documents</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>TRANSFERABLE DOCUMENTS</strong></h4>
<p>Ownership of these digital documents can be securely transferred from
one party to another using the blockchain technology. This process is secure
and enables legal ownership transfers without requiring physical legal
contracts because digital documents have the same legal status as physical
paper documents through compliance to MLETR requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When using TradeTrust-enabled electronic documents across MLETR-aligned
and/or non-MLETR-aligned jurisdiction, it is recommended <strong>to expressly choose a governing law and jurisdiction provision</strong> for
the documents <strong>with a MLETR jurisdiction.</strong>
