third_nav_title: What is TradeTrust
---
<p>There are two main types of business documents: Verifiable and Transferable.
These documents are commonly saved in digital format. It can be difficult
to prove the origin and authenticity of regular electronic documents to
facilitate the transfer of digital records of ownership of goods and titles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the TradeTrust framework, you can secure any digital document to
protect its authenticity and control the possession and actions like endorsement
and revocation</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>NORMAL DOCUMENTS OR VERIFIABLE DOCUMENTS</strong></h4>
<p>These are specific trade documents that are non-transferable, such as
Certificates of Origin (CoO), Invoices, and promissory notes.</p>
<p>Without a definite framework , anyone can claim the authority to verify
and authenticate the digital documents. TradeTrust provides legal certainty
and assurance when issuing or receiving such documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Examples of how TradeTrust improves the workflow for Verifiable Documents</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>TRANSFERABLE DOCUMENTS</strong></h4>
<p>Title ownership of these digital documents can be securely transferred
from one party to another using the blockchain technology. This process
is secure and enables legal ownership transfers without requiring physical
legal contracts because digital documents have the same legal status as
physical paper documents through compliance to MLETR requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>These documents will be generated into TradeTrust file, with a .TT file
extension for example <a href="http://filename.tt" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">filename.tt</a>. They can be exchanged over your
existing business/IT and data interchange system like email, FTP and regardless
of data format or standard like DCSA’s and BIMCO’s.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When using TradeTrust-enabled electronic documents across MLETR-aligned
and/or non-MLETR-aligned jurisdiction, it is recommended to expressly choose
a governing law and jurisdiction provision for the documents with a MLETR
jurisdiction.</p>
