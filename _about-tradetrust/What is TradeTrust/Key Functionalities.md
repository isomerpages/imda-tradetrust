<h4>THREE Key Functionalities</h4>
<p>By adopting TradeTrust, you can issue, exchange and/or receive TradeTrust-issued
electronic documents know as TrustDoc files. These files allow intended
recipients to:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Verify the authenticity : </strong>Any tampering would be evident</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verify the provenance : </strong>Genuine creators of documents
like Carriers, Govt authorities
<br>TradeTrust uses Decentralised Identifiers^ (DID) and digital signatures
to&nbsp;verify the source and authenticity of documents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Effect title transfer :</strong> Legally-valid Performance Obligation
Transfer.
<br>TradeTrust uses blockchain technology to create Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
to represent title ownership and enable transfers&nbsp;from one party to
the next.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>By reducing the costs and risks associated with paper-based documentation,<strong> </strong>TradeTrust
connects governments and businesses to a public blockchain, ensuring trusted
interoperability of electronic trade documents and facilitating smooth
title transfers of transferable documents across digital platforms.</p>
