<h4><strong><a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/regulations-and-licensing-listing/electronic-transactions-act-and-regulations" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singaporeâ€™s Electronic Transactions Act</a></strong></h4>
<p>Yes, TradeTrust is designed to comply with <strong><a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/regulations-and-licensing-listing/electronic-transactions-act-and-regulations" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Electronic Transactions Act</a></strong> (ETA),
which is in line with other global jurisdictions adopting the United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Electronic
Transferable Records (MLETR).&nbsp; In 2021, Singapore updated its laws
to recognise electronic trade documents that follow international standards
legally, the UNCITRAL MLETR. &nbsp;TradeTrust documents that comply with
UNCITRAL MLETR are legally valid across borders.</p>
<h4><strong>Global Standards</strong></h4>
<p>The TradeTrust framework adheres to the requirements by international
standards bodies like the UN/CEFACT, W3C and UNESCAP. Adopting TradeTrust
means following internationally recognised standards and accreditation.</p>
<h4><strong>Accreditation&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Technical solutions are certified to meet legal requirements. Ernst &amp;
Young audited, also reviewed, and assessed the TradeTrust framework in
2021 to ensure its reliability and trustworthiness.</p>
