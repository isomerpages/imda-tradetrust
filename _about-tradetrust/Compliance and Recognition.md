which is in line with other global jurisdictions adopting the United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Electronic
Transferable Records (MLETR).&nbsp; In 2021, Singapore updated its laws
to recognise electronic trade documents. TradeTrust-enabled documents comply
with UNCITRAL MLETR are legally valid across borders.</p>
<h4><strong>Global Standards</strong></h4>

standards bodies like the UN/CEFACT, W3C and UNESCAP. Adopting TradeTrust
means following internationally recognised standards and accreditation.</p>
<h4><strong>Accreditation&nbsp;</strong></h4>

Young audited, also reviewed, and assessed the TradeTrust framework in
2021 to ensure its reliability and trustworthiness.</p>
<h4><strong>W3C Verifiable Credentials</strong></h4>
<p>A verifiable credential comprises tamper-evident claims and metadata that
cryptographically establish its issuer. Examples include digital employee
identification cards, birth certificates, and educational certificates.
TradeTrust leverages W3C Verifiable Credentials to provide tamper-evident,
cryptographically proven sets of claims and metadata, ensuring the authenticity
and integrity of digital documents on the blockchain.</p>
<h4><strong>ERC-721</strong></h4>
<p>An NFT (Non-Fungible Token) uniquely identifies something or someone.
The ERC-721 (Ethereum Request for Comments 721) is a standard for NFT.
TradeTrust utilizes ERC-721 for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to uniquely
identify and represent title ownership on the blockchain.</p>
