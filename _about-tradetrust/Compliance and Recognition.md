<p>Yes, TradeTrust is designed to be compliant with <a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/regulations-and-licensing-listing/electronic-transactions-act-and-regulations" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore’s Electronic Transactions Act</a> (ETA),
which has been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">harmonised</a> &nbsp;
with other global jurisdictions that also adopt the UNCITRAL MLETR.&nbsp;In
2021, Singapore updated its laws to legally recognise electronic trade
documents that follow international standards, the UNCITRAL MLETR. TradeTrust
documents that comply with UNCITRAL MLETR are legally valid across borders.
There is no need for separate legal contracts or rulebooks.</p>

standards bodies like the UN/CEFACT, ISO and UNESCAP. Adopting TradeTrust
means following internationally recognised standards and accreditation.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Accreditation&nbsp;</strong></h4>

&amp; Young audited, also reviewed, and assessed the TradeTrust framework
in 2021 to ensure its reliability and trustworthiness.</p>
