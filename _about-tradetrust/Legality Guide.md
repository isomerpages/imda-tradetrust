<h3><strong>Singapore's Electronic Transactions Act</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;In March 2021, the Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) was amended
to align Singapore’s legal and regulatory infrastructure with international
trade law and the latest technological advancements. The amendment adopted
the Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR) published by the
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. This allows Singapore’s
jurisdiction to legally recognise Electronic Transferable Records as functional
equivalents to their paper versions; meaning the creation and use of transferable
documents by businesses and government, govern under the Singapore’s legal
system, are legally valid.</p>

<h3><strong><u>Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records</u></strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<h4></h4>
<p>In 2017, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)
published the Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR). This
law allows the legal use of electronic transferable records (ETRs) within
countries and across borders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Countries and territories, including Singapore, the Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, New York, Delaware, Bahrain, Papua New Guinea, Belize,
Kiribati, Paraguay and the Abu Dhabi Global Markets in the United Arab
Emirates are MLETR- compliant.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>When businesses and government bodies adopt TradeTrust, they can easily
implement ETRs like electronic Bills of Lading.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of contractual
rule book, your TradeTrust-enabled electronic documents will be supported
by statutory law.</p>
<p>When using these electronic documents across MLETR-aligned and/or non-MLETR-aligned
jurisdiction, it is recommended to expressly choose a governing law and
jurisdiction provision for the documents with a MLETR jurisdiction like
Singapore, New York, Delaware or other MLETR-compliant jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Using an example of a shipment from a non MLETR-compliant jurisdiction
like China to Singapore, as long as the TradeTrust-issued electronic Bill
of Lading (eBL) by carrier is governed by a MLETR-compliant jurisdiction
such as Singapore, the eBL will be legally valid to facilitate the shipment.</p>
