<h4><strong><u>Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records</u></strong></h4>
<p>In 2017, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)
published the Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR). This
law allows the legal use of electronic transferable records (ETRs) within
countries and across borders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Countries and territories, including Singapore, the Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, New York, Delaware, Bahrain, Papua New Guinea, Belize,
Kiribati, Paraguay and the Abu Dhabi Global Markets in the United Arab
Emirates have adopted MLETR into their laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>

<p>Global trade has relied heavily on paper documents for centuries despite
their legal, financial, and practical disadvantages. However, new technologies
and legal developments now enable the use of electronic transferable documents,
such as electronic bills of lading (eBLs). These electronic documents can
be used on any digital platform, making them easy for all parties to adopt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TradeTrust is a framework and digital tool that secures electronic documents
to be verified and trusted across different digital platforms and systems.
When businesses and other entities adopt TradeTrust, they can easily implement
ETRs like eBLs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>TradeTrust-enabled eBLs follow all requirements set out in the MLETR law.
This means they are legally valid and can be used across multiple platforms
and frameworks in countries that have adopted MLETR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of contractual rule book, your TradeTrust-enabled electronic documents
will be supported by statutory law. When using these electronic documents
across MLETR-aligned and/or non-MLETR-aligned jurisdiction, it is recommended
to expressly choose a governing law and jurisdiction provision for the
documents with a MLETR jurisdiction like Singapore, New York, Delaware
or other MLETR-compliant jurisdictions. Using an example of a shipment
from a non MLETR-compliant jurisdiction like China to Singapore, as long
as the TradeTrust-issued electronic Bill of Lading (eBL) by carrier is
governed by a MLETR-compliant jurisdiction such as Singapore, the eBL will
be legally valid to facilitate the shipment.</p>
