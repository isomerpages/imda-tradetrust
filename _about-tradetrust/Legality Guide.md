<h4><strong><u>Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records</u></strong></h4>
<p>In 2017, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)
published the Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR). This
law allows the legal use of electronic transferable records (ETRs) within
countries and across borders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seven countries and territories, including Singapore, the UK and the US,
have adopted MLETR into their laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>

<p>Global trade has relied heavily on paper documents for centuries despite
their legal, financial and practical disadvantages. However, new technologies
and legal developments now enable the use of electronic transferable documents,
such as electronic bills of lading (eBLs). These electronic documents can
be used on any digital platform so there is no conflict between the sender
and receiver, it is easy for everyone to use.</p>
<p>TradeTrust is a framework and digital tool that secures electronic documents
to be verified and trusted across different digital platforms and systems.
When businesses and other entities adopt TradeTrust, they can easily implement
ETRs like eBLs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>TradeTrust-enabled eBLs follow all requirements set out in the MLETR law.
This means they are legally valid and can be used across multiple platforms
and frameworks in countries that have adopted MLETR.&nbsp;</p>
