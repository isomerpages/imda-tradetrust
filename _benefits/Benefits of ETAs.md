<p>Singapore’s Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) recognises the validity
of electronic records, signatures, and transactions. Introduced in 1998,
it was amended in 2021 to adopt the UNCITRAL MLETR, which allows the legal
use of documents like electronic bills of lading (eBLs).</p>
<p>Key benefits of the ETA.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Legally Secured</u></strong></h4>
<p>It makes digital documents legally valid. Electronic records and signatures
have the same legal status as paper documents.</p>
<h4><strong><u>No more paper trails.</u></strong></h4>
<p>It enables companies and agencies to remove paper from their processes
and go fully digital.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Swift and Cost Efficient</u></strong></h4>
<p>As digital transactions are faster and cheaper than dealing with physical
documents, they increase efficiency and cost savings.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Digitally Secured</u></strong></h4>
<p>It provides a secured legal framework for businesses and agencies to conduct
transactions online securely.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Globally Recognised</u></strong></h4>
<p>Establishing secure guidelines, gives confidence and global recognition.</p>
