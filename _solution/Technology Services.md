<h3>How TradeTrust can help in Technology Services</h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>TradeTrust is not a platform, is not a competitor to existing platforms</strong>.
Instead, TradeTrust provides a solution to the current lack of technical
interoperability in the market by enabling any party to digitise any document
and issue its own TradeTrust-enabled Electronic Transferable Records (ETRs)
outside of the confines of any contract-based platform.</p>
<p>It functions as middleware that can be plugged into different blockchains.
This means you can ensure authenticity, verify the source, and validate
the legal transfer of trade obligations at the application layer.</p>
<p></p>

<li>
<p><strong>Interoperability</strong>
<br>Partner with anyone, regardless of technology</p>
<p></p>
<p>TradeTrust is system, semantic/data and protocols agnostic. You can choose
from industry data standards like DCSA’s and BIMCO’s and any existing transmission
protocol like email, FTP.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decentralized approach</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>removes the need for expensive data exchange infrastructure to be put
in place in between you and exchanging parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>removes tight coupling and inter-dependencies between exchanging systems.
This means exchanging parties like you and your trading partners can proceed
to upgrade and make changes to the IT systems at your own pace according
to your own priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removes the need that you and your trading community to sign up to one
single platform. You have one lesser login credential to remember.</p>
