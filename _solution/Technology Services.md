<h3>How TradeTrust can help in Technology Services</h3>
<p>Whether you are from IT department serving your internal end-users or
a Business Service Provider (BSP), the set of TradeTrust software components
is available free for all so that you can easily integrate into your backend
business solution/application or proprietary platform.</p>
<p><strong>TradeTrust is not a platform, is not a competitor to existing platform</strong>s.
Instead, TradeTrust provides a solution to the current lack of technical
interoperability in the market by enabling any party to issue its own TT
Electronic Transferable Records (ETRs) outside of the confines of any contract-based
platform.</p>
<p>It functions as middleware that can be plugged into different blockchains.
This means you can ensure authenticity, verify the source, and validate
the legal transfer of trade obligations.</p>

<p>Automatic documentation processing</p>
<p>Banks and financiers could also leverage their upgraded systems with TradeTrust
set of software components to converge physical, financial and document
chains. This means making automation of key processes possible like automating
validation of documentations, payments and release of funds when conditions
are met. Identify and authenticity verification makes customer onboarding
easy.</p>

<li>
<p>Tokenised and fractionalised digital assets for financing</p>
<p>Traditional banks and alternative financing platforms have long provided
liquidity and capital to businesses.</p>
<p>By tokenizing real-world assets through the use of Bills of Lading and
warehouse receipts, it becomes possible to trade and finance smaller fractions
of assets. This revolutionizes the investment process, opening up new opportunities
in both the supply and demand sides of the market.</p>
