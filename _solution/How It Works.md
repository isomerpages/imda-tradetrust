<p>You can digitise any business documents into two document types:</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;<strong>Verifiable Documents&nbsp;</strong>for example certificates
of origin and packing lists; and
<br>(2)&nbsp;<strong>Transferable Documents</strong>&nbsp;for example Electronic
Transferable Records (ETRs) such as electronic Bills of Lading and warehouse
receipts</p>
<p>These TradeTrust-enabled electronic documents generated are saved as TradeTrust
file with a .TT file extension (<a href="http://filename.tt" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">filename.tt</a>). They can be exchanged over
your existing business/IT and data interchange system like email, FTP and
regardless of data format or standard like DCSA’s and BIMCO’s.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>And, when you and your trading partners uniformly adopt TradeTrust to
process trade documentation, it eliminates the need for all parties to
use a common digital platform and contractual rulebook. This decentralized
approach makes scalability possible.</p>
