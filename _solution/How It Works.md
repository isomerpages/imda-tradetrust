<p>You can digitise any business documents into two document types:
<br>1. <strong>Verifiable Documents&nbsp;</strong>for example certificates
of origin and packing lists; and
<br>2. <strong>Transferable Documents</strong>&nbsp;for example Electronic
Transferable Records (ETRs) such as electronic Bills of Lading and warehouse
receipts</p>
<p>These TradeTrust-enabled electronic documents are saved as TradeTrust
file with a .TT file extension. They can be transmitted via your upgraded
IT business application and existing data interchange system like email,
FTP and regardless of data format or standard like DCSA’s and BIMCO’s.</p>
<p>And, when you and your trading partners uniformly adopt TradeTrust to
process trade documentation, it eliminates the need for all parties to
use a common digital platform and contractual rulebook. This decentralized
approach makes scalability possible.</p>
