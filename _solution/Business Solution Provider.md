<h3>How TradeTrust can help in Technology Services</h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>TradeTrust is not a platform. It does not compete with existing platforms but serves as a complementary digital utility to assist platforms in achieving scalability of their products.</strong> Instead,
TradeTrust provides a solution to the current lack of technical interoperability
in the market by enabling any party to digitise any document and issue
its own TradeTrust-enabled Electronic Transferable Records (ETRs) outside
of the confines of any contract-based platform.</p>
<p>It functions as middleware (an adaptor) which can be plugged into existing
platforms. This ensures authenticity, verifies the source, and validates
the legal transfer of trade obligations at the application layer, regardless
of how a party receives a document or at which stage of the supply chain
a party receives it.</p>

<p><strong>Interoperability</strong>
<br>Partner with anyone, regardless of technology to drive efficiency and
lower cost of business.</p>
<p></p>
<p>TradeTrust is system, semantic/data and transmission agnostic.</p>
<p>• <u>System agnostic</u>: Almost any system can integrate the TT software
components to acquire the functionalities of TT.
<br>• <u>Semantic/data format agnostic:</u> You can freely choose from data
format standards such as the Key Trade Documents and Data Elements (KTDDE)
specifications by ICC DSI and/or BL data format standards from DCS and
BIMCO and/or any data format agreed upon by you and your business partners.
<br>• <u>Transmission agnostic</u>: You can freely choose to use any existing
transmission protocol like email, FTP etc. to transport the TradeTrust
file from party to party.</p>
