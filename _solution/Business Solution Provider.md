<h3>How TradeTrust can help in Technology Services</h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>TradeTrust is not a platform. It does not compete with existing platforms but serves as a complementary digital utility to assist platforms in achieving scalability of their products.</strong>
</p>
<p>TradeTrust provides a solution to the current lack of technical interoperability
in the market by enabling any party to digitise any document and issue
its own TradeTrust-enabled ETRs outside of the confines of any contract-based
platform.</p>
<p>It functions as a middleware (an adaptor) which can be plugged into existing
platforms. This ensures authenticity, verifies the source, and validates
the legal transfer of trade obligations at the application layer, regardless
of how a party receives a document or at which stage of the supply chain
a party receives it.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Interoperability</strong>
<br>Partner with anyone, regardless of technology capability, to drive efficiency
and lower cost of business.</p>
<p></p>
<p>TradeTrust is system-, semantic/data format- and transmission agnostic.</p>
<p>• <u>System agnostic</u>: Almost any system can integrate the TradeTrust
software components to acquire the functionalities of TradeTrust.
<br>• <u>Semantic/data format agnostic:</u> You can freely choose from data
format standards such as the Key Trade Documents and Data Elements (KTDDE)
specifications by ICC Digital Standards Initiative (DSI) and/or BL data
format standards from Digital Container Shipping Association(DCSA) and
BIMCO and/or any data format agreed upon by you and your business partners.
<br>• <u>Transmission agnostic</u>: You can freely choose to use any existing
transmission protocols like email, FTP etc. to transport the TradeTrust
file from party to party.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decentralised approach for scalability</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Remove the need for expensive data exchange infrastructure to be put in
place in between you and exchanging parties</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove tight coupling and inter-dependencies between exchanging systems.
This means exchanging parties like you and your trading partners can proceed
to upgrade and make changes to the IT systems at your own pace according
to your own priorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the need for all parties (you and your trading community) to use
one single platform as TradeTrust-enabled documents are portable across
different TradeTrust-ready platforms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compliance to internationally recognised</strong>  <strong>standards</strong>
