<h3>How TradeTrust can help in Technology Services</h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>TradeTrust is not a platform, is not a competitor to existing platforms</strong>.
Instead, TradeTrust provides a solution to the current lack of technical
interoperability in the market by enabling any party to digitise any document
and issue its own TradeTrust-enabled Electronic Transferable Records (ETRs)
outside of the confines of any contract-based platform.</p>
<p>It functions as middleware that can be plugged into different blockchains.
This means you can ensure authenticity, verify the source, and validate
the legal transfer of trade obligations at the application layer.</p>

from industry data standards like DCSA’s and BIMCO’s and any existing transmission
protocol like email, FTP.</p>

<p>Removes the need that you and your trading community to sign up to one
single platform.</p>
