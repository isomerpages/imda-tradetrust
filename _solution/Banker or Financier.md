<h3>How TradeTrust can help in Financial Services</h3>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Support digital&nbsp;ledger&nbsp;payment commitment</strong>
</p>
<p>Trade finance activities are notoriously paper-heavy.</p>
<p>TradeTrust can transform the management of digital ledger payment commitments
by providing a secure, transparent, and immutable platform for recording
and managing payment obligations using blockchain and distributed ledger
technology. This enhances the security and transparency of payment commitments,
streamlining the overall payment process and reducing the risk of disputes
and errors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Banks and alternative financiers can integrate physical, financial, and
document chains, automating key processes such as document validation,
payments, and fund release upon meeting conditions. By offering digital
trade finance, it provides overall convenience and cost savings for all
parties in the supply chain, faster trade transactions, improved document
checks for compliance and validity, thereby providing assurance to financial
institutions, banks' customers and their trading partners.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mitigate risk &amp; Compliance Checks</strong>
</p>
<p>Trade finance banks often rely on bills of lading (BLs) as security for
the transactions they finance. In the event of cargo loss and customer
insolvency, the bank's security could be significantly compromised if the
BL does not provide rights of suit against a carrier for loss in transit
or failure to properly care for the cargo.</p>
<p>TradeTrust-enabled trade documents are supported by statutory laws aligned
with UNCITRALâ€™s Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR). The
use of TradeTrust-enabled eBLs could offer greater assurance to banks for
their security interests, as immutable records of ownership are maintained
on a blockchain, represented by an endorsement chain that also serves as
an audit trail. As you can trace the ownership and holdership of documents,
this helps to prevent double or multiple financing.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Tokenised and fractionalised digital assets for financing</strong>
</p>
<p>Traditional banks and alternative financing platforms have long provided
liquidity and capital to businesses.</p>
<p>By tokenizing real-world assets for example through the use of bills of
lading, account receivables and warehouse receipts, it becomes possible
to trade and finance smaller fractions of assets. This revolutionizes the
investment process, opening up new opportunities in both the supply and
demand sides of the market. This improves access to working capital financing
for exporters/importers and fills the trade finance gap.</p>
