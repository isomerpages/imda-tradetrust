<h3>How TradeTrust can help in Financial Services</h3>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Trade Finance Process Optimisation</strong>
</p>
<p>Trade finance activities are notoriously paper-heavy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Using TradeTrust to digitalise key trade documents streamlines the trade
process and reduces the time required for document processing and verification.
This can result in quicker trade transactions and reduced turnaround times
for trade finance activities, particularly in complex transactions involving
multiple banks, insurers, and corporate customers, as TradeTrust supports
interoperability of electronic trade documents across various platforms
and systems.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thereby providing overall convenience and cost savings for all parties
in the supply chain, with better document checks for compliance and validity,
providing assurance to banks' customers and their trading partners.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mitigate risk &amp; Compliance Checks</strong>
</p>
<p>Trade finance banks often rely on bills of lading (BLs) as security for
the transactions they finance. In the event of cargo loss and customer
insolvency, the bank's security could be significantly compromised if the
BL does not provide rights of suit against a carrier for loss in transit
or failure to properly care for the cargo.</p>
<p>TradeTrust-enabled trade documents are supported by statutory laws aligned
with UNCITRALâ€™s Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR). The
use of TradeTrust-enabled eBLs could offer greater assurance to banks for
their security interests, as immutable records of ownership are maintained
on a blockchain, represented by an endorsement chain that also serves as
an audit trail.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tokenised and fractionalised digital assets for financing</strong>
</p>
<p>Traditional banks and alternative financing platforms have long provided
liquidity and capital to businesses.</p>
<p>By tokenizing real-world assets for example through the use of Bills of
Lading and warehouse receipts, it becomes possible to trade and finance
smaller fractions of assets. This revolutionizes the investment process,
opening up new opportunities in both the supply and demand sides of the
market.</p>
