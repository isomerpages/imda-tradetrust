<h3>Use Case</h3>
<h4><strong><u>Tokenised and fractionalised digital assets for financing</u></strong></h4>
<p>Traditional banks and alternative financing platforms have long provided
liquidity and capital to businesses. However, the emergence of tokens recorded
on blockchains introduces a new dimension.</p>
<p>By tokenizing real-world assets through the use of Bills of Lading and
warehouse receipts, it becomes possible to trade and finance smaller fractions
of assets. This revolutionizes the investment process, opening up new opportunities
in both the supply and demand sides of the market.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Automatic documentation processing</u></strong></h4>
<p>Banks and financiers could also leverage their upgraded systems with TradeTrust
set of software components to converge physical, financial and document
chains. This means making automation of key processes possible like automating
validation of documentations, payments and release of funds when conditions
are met</p>
<p>By digitizing bills of lading with TradeTrust, as an issuer, you can enable
system interoperability and platform-agnostic, seamless data exchange with
your supply chain partners.</p>
<p>When a electronic bills of lading issued by Carrier is received, the same
electronic bills of lading can be used to facilitate trade finance by traders,
trade compliance and marine cargo shipping arrangement by logistics service
providers.</p>
<p>Taking blank endorsed Bill of Lading as an example, the electronic version
issued with TradeTrust's technical method will allow the transfer of title
from one party to another seamlessly for trade financing.</p>
