<p>Currently, TradeTrust can be connected to 5 different public blockchain
networks:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Ethereum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pï»¿olygon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XDC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hedera</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stability</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And depending on your role in the supply chain, transaction costs such
as blockchain gas fees may apply. Below are the estimated fees (USD) computed
as at 2 Feb 2023 for a typical series of transactions from the issuance
to surrender of electronic bill of lading (<em>costs distributed among different stakeholders)</em>:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Estimated Fees on Ethereum: &lt; USD $20</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estimated Fees on Polygon: &lt; USD $0.16</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do note that the cost estimated above involves the whole chain of endorsements
(NFT transactions) for a transferable document like eBL. This cost is expected
to be shared across multiple transaction parties in the eBL value chain.</p>
