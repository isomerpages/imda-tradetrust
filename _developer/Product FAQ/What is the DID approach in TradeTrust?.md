<p>Decentralized identifiers (<a href="https://docs.tradetrust.io/docs/topics/introduction/issuer-method-dns-did" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">DID</a>s)
enable businesses to establish trust and verify the authenticity of digital
identities without relying on a central authority. This can be particularly
useful for secure and efficient interactions with customers, partners,
and other entities, while giving the business more control over its digital
identity infrastructure.</p>
<p>The DID approach is recommended for verifiable documents. The issuance
of normal/verifiable documents will not incur any gas fee, as there is
no need to write on the blockchain. Learn <a href="https://docs.tradetrust.io/docs/topics/introduction/issuer-method-dns-did" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">more</a>.
However, revocation of the issued verifiable document will require the
setup of document store and hence will incur gas fee. Learn <a href="https://docs.tradetrust.io/docs/tutorial/verifiable-documents/advanced/document-store/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">more</a>.</p>
