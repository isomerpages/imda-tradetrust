<p>Decentralized identifiers (<a href="https://docs.tradetrust.io/docs/topics/introduction/issuer-method-dns-did" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">DID</a>s)
enable businesses to establish trust and verify the authenticity of digital
identities without relying on a central authority. This can be particularly
useful for secure and efficient interactions with customers, partners,
and other entities, while giving the business more control over its digital
identity infrastructure.</p>
<p>The DID approach is suitable for verifiable documents. The issuance of
normal/verifiable documents will not incur any gas fee since there is no
need to write on blockchain. However, revocation of the issued verifiable
document will require the setup of document store and hence will incur
gas fee. Refer to <a href="https://docs.tradetrust.io/docs/advanced/aws-kms/did-sign-demo" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.tradetrust.io/docs/advanced/aws-kms/did-sign-demo </a>for
