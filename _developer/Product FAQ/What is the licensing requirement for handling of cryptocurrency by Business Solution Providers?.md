<p>Business Solution Providers that have integrated TradeTrust to provide
digital services dealing with electronic transferable records such as eBLs,
will typically manage the cryptocurrencies required to pay their clients’
recording of their NFT transactions.</p>
<p>For such payments, the TradeTrust team has consulted MAS’s regulatory
team on the need for a licensing requirement. MAS has advised that if the
Business Solution Providers are not facilitating the buying and selling
of digital payment tokens (DPT) and arranging the transmission of DPTs
from one account to another, they would <strong>not </strong>be deemed to
be carrying on a business of providing a DPT service under the Payment
Services Act 2019.</p>
<p>MAS further recommends that Business Solution Providers perform their
own legal and compliance review before proceeding.</p>
