<p>As TradeTrust is designed to facilitate trusted digital document exchanges
used in cross-border trade and logistics processes, our target audiences
therefore involve many different parties across different geographies.
Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology is used as it can demonstrate
provenance, which is required for the legitimacy of documents such as Bills
of Lading. One of UNCITRAL MLETRâ€™s requirements for electronic transferable
records is to ensure singularity of the record. TradeTrust uses Non-Fungible
Tokens (NFTs) to satisfy this requirement when dealing with Transferable
documents and Blockchain is used to record the NFT transactions.</p>
<p>TradeTrust relies on public blockchain technology (<strong>Ethereum, Polygon, XDC, Hedera and Stability</strong>)
to electronically endorse and transfer the ownership of a trade financing
document amongst the stakeholders along a trade flow. TradeTrust deliberately
chose to use public blockchain, as in a global setting, there should be
no need for a central authority to govern the network and gatekeep participation.
Public blockchains also allow for an open and interoperable system that
enables all international parties to participate.</p>
<p>TradeTrust caters to the following blockchain networks.</p>
