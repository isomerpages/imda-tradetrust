<p>Business Solution Providers that have integrated TradeTrust to provide
digital services dealing with electronic transferable records such as eBLs,
will typically manage the cryptocurrencies required to pay for their clients’
recording of their NFT transactions.</p>
<p>For such payments, MAS’s regulatory team has been consulted if there is
a need for a licensing requirement. MAS has advised that if the Business
Solution Providers are not facilitating the buying and selling of digital
payment tokens (DPT) and arranging the transmission of DPTs from one account
to another, they would <strong>not </strong>be deemed as conducting on a
business of providing a DPT service under the Payment Services Act 2019.</p>
<p>MAS further recommends that Business Solution Providers perform their
own legal and compliance review before proceeding.</p>
