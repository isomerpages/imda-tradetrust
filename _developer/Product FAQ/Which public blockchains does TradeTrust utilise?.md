<p>TradeTrust relies on <strong>public blockchain</strong> technology enabled
by <strong>Ethereum, Polygon, XDC, Hedera and Stability </strong>(crypto-less)
to electronically endorse and transfer the ownership of a document amongst
stakeholders along a trade flow. Public blockchains allow for an open and
interoperable system, enabling all international parties to participate.</p>
<p>TradeTrust caters to the following blockchain networks.</p>
<p>1. Mainnet: <a href="https://www.tradetrust.io" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.tradetrust.io</a>.
The mainnet supports Ethereum, Polygon, XDC, Hedera and Stability (Global
Trust Network).</p>
<p>2. Testnet: <a href="https://dev.tradetrust.io" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://dev.tradetrust.io</a>.
The testnet environment utilises Sepolia (Ethereum Testnet ), Polygon Mumbai,
XDC Apothem, Hedera Testnet and Stability (Global Trust Network Testnet).</p>
<p>TradeTrust does not host nodes. Instead, it uses services from providers
such as Alchemy, Infura, and QuickNode.</p>
