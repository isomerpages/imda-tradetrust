<h2>How to Start with TradeTrust</h2>
<p></p>
<h3><u>To verify TradeTrust-issued documents :</u></h3>
<p>As a recipient of TradeTrust-issued documents such as electronic Bills
of Lading or Certificates of Origin, you can verify the documents’ proof
of origin and authenticity via
<br>o&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Verify Doc</strong>  <strong>service </strong>which
enables easy verification with a simple document (also known as TradeDoc)
file upload. The service is available at <a href="https://www.tradetrust.io/verify" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.tradetrust.io/verify</a> and
other websites provided by TradeTrust-enabled Business Service Providers
<br>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>QR codes</strong> (if enabled) in TradeTrust-issued
documents for online verification simply with smartphone camera scanning</p>
<p>Verification can be done anywhere, anytime with Internet access – no matter
how many hands the document has been through.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><u>To issue documents and/or transfer title ownership for title documents :</u></h3>
<p><strong>TradeTrust is not a platform </strong>but a set of open-source
software components that sit in between the business application and blockchain
layer. This architecture allows businesses or governments to enhance their
proprietary IT systems or platforms with TradeTrust’s capabilities, independent
of the underlying blockchain technologies.</p>
