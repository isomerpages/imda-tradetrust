<h2>How to Start with TradeTrust</h2>
<p></p>
<h3><u>To verify TradeTrust-issued documents :</u></h3>
<p>As a recipient of TradeTrust-issued documents such as electronic Bills
of Lading or Certificates of Origin, you can verify the documents’ proof
of origin and authenticity via
<br>o&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Verify Doc</strong>  <strong>service </strong>which
enables easy verification with a simple document (also known as TradeDoc)
file upload. This service is available at <a href="https://www.tradetrust.io/verify" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.tradetrust.io/verify</a> for
free and other websites provided by TradeTrust-enabled Business Service
Providers
<br>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>QR codes</strong> (if enabled) in TradeTrust-issued
documents for online verification simply with smartphone camera scanning</p>
<p>Verification can be done anywhere, anytime with Internet access independently
– no matter how many hands the document has been through. <strong>No integration required!</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<h3><u>To issue documents and/or transfer title ownership for transferable documents :</u></h3>
<p><strong>TradeTrust is not a platform </strong>but a set of open-source
software components that sit in between the business application and blockchain
layer. This architecture allows businesses or governments to enhance their
proprietary IT systems or platforms with TradeTrust’s capabilities, independent
of the underlying blockchain technologies.</p>

<p>Which types of business documents are involved? Verifiable and/or transferable
documents?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you issue/transfer title or simply verify documents?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choice of blockchain(s)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blockchain gas fees</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of cryptocurrency (applicable for the issuance and transfer of title
ownership for transferable documents, and issuance in batch or revoke verifiable
documents)</p>
</li>

<p>Installation of crypto wallet (for example Metamask)</p>
<p></p>
