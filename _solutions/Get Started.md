<h2>How to Start with TradeTrust</h2>
<p></p>
<p><strong>TradeTrust is not a platform </strong>but a set of open-source
software components that sit in between the business application and blockchain
layer. This architecture allows businesses or governments to enhance your
proprietary IT systems or platforms with TradeTrust’s capability, independent
of the underlying blockchain technologies.</p>
<h4><u>To verify TradeTrust-issued documents :</u></h4>
<p>Anyone who received TradeTrust-issued documents can verify them via :
<br>o&nbsp;&nbsp;Verify Doc service on TradeTrust website enables easy verification
with a simple document upload

codes for online verification using smartphone camera scanning</p>
<p>Verification can be done anywhere, anytime with Internet access – no matter
how many hands the document has been through.</p>
