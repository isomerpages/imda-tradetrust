<h3>Transferable Document Interoperability</h3>
<p></p>
<p>During the shipment of goods from the exporter to importer, electronic
Bill of Lading (eBL) is issued by the Carrier for ocean cargo facilitation.</p>
<p>In a typical trade finance with blank endorsed BL<strong> </strong>use
case<strong>,</strong> exporter uses negotiating bank for documents presentation;
while importer uses issuing bank for capital provision and documents release.
The eBL is issued and title transferred from one party to another for capital
provision and cargo movement.</p>
