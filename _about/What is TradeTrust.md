<h3><strong><u>One Framework for Trade Digitalisation</u></strong></h3>
<p>TradeTrust is designed as an enabler to transform your trade digitalisation
journey.</p>
<p><strong>TradeTrust is a framework that standardises digital trade with enhanced security and legal certainty for international trade ecosystem.</strong>
</p>
<p>TradeTrust achieves this by using blockchain and cryptographic technologies,
adhering to global standards and legal requirements to enable trusted portability
of electronic trade documents across digital platforms. Electronic documents
issued this way can be trusted, interoperable, and legally effective across
different systems, thereby streamlining and enhancing overall operational
efficiency for businesses and governments.</p>
<p>And offered as a<strong> digital utility </strong>(similar to digital
public infrastructure or digital public goods), it is open-sourced so that
all parties can freely adopt and build upon it to benefit their business
ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s like providing you with both a free tool and the supporting structure,
to turn your documents into smart electronic documents that are portable
across your trading partners, with enhanced security features, all while
meeting international standards and legal requirements.</p>
</blockquote>

</p>
</li>

<summary><strong>Why is public blockchains used?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>TradeTrust utilises public Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology
to demonstrate provenance that is essential for the legitimacy of documents
such as Bills of Lading. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are used to ensure
the singularity of the record for transferable documents, with blockchain
recording the NFT transactions to electronically endorse and transfer the
ownership of a document among stakeholders along a trade flow. This choice
was deliberate to <strong>eliminate the need for a central authority</strong> or
body to govern the network and gatekeep participation, allowing for an
open and interoperable system for all international parties to participate
seamlessly.</p>
