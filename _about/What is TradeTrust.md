<h3><strong><u>One Framework for Trade Digitalisation</u></strong></h3>
<p>TradeTrust is designed as an enabler to transform your trade digitalisation
journey.</p>
<p><strong>TradeTrust is a framework that standardises digital trade with enhanced security and legal certainty for the international trade ecosystem.</strong>
</p>
<p>TradeTrust achieves this by using blockchain and cryptographic technologies,
adhering to global standards and legal requirements to enable trusted portability
of electronic trade documents across digital platforms. Electronic documents
issued this way can be trusted, interoperable, and legally effective across
different systems, thereby streamlining and enhancing overall operational
efficiency for businesses and governments.</p>
<p>And offered as a<strong> digital utility </strong>(similar to digital
public infrastructure or digital public goods), it is open-sourced so that
all parties can freely adopt and build upon it to benefit their business
ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s like providing you with both a free tool and the supporting structure,
to turn your documents into smart electronic documents that are portable
across your trading partners, with enhanced security features, all while
meeting international standards and legal requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By adopting TradeTrust, users can independently :</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>issue and revoke electronic documents</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>verify documents’ proof of source and authenticity</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>transfer titles for transferable documents</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>To enjoy all the capabilities of TradeTrust from the convenience of the
system you are familiar with, you can just integrate TradeTrust into your
existing IT system. Alternatively, outsource or subscribe to the services
of TradeTrust-ready <a href="/community/tradetrust-ready-partners/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">partners</a>. This flexibility
allows you and your trading partners to choose your preferred TradeTrust-enabled
system, eliminating the need for all parties to use a common digital platform
and contractual rulebook, thus facilitating easy scalability of adoption.</p>
<p>And to verify documents received, only an internet access is required.</p>
<p>Having your documents and instruments available in electronic form can
greatly benefit you by improving the speed and security of your transactions,
allowing you to reuse data, and automating certain transactions. This makes
trading more efficient and convenient for you and your trading partners.</p>

<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Are my data and transactions safe?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Your data resides in the electronic document files generated and is not
written into the public blockchain to preserve data confidentiality. Only
the title ownership is tracked through the use of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
on one of the selected blockchains for title documents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And the security and reliability of TradeTrust is ensured through the
vulnerability assessment and penetration testing of the Smart Contract
Code conducted by a third-party specialist, Ernst &amp; Young.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Why are public blockchains used?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>TradeTrust utilises public blockchains or Distributed Ledger Technology
to demonstrate provenance that is essential for the legitimacy of documents
such as Bills of Lading.
<br>
<br>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are used to ensure the singularity of the record
for transferable documents, with the blockchain recording the NFT transactions
to electronically endorse and transfer the ownership of a document among
stakeholders along a trade flow.
<br>
<br>This choice was deliberate to eliminate the need for a central authority
or body to govern the network and gatekeep participation, allowing for
an open and interoperable system for all international parties to participate
seamlessly.</p>
