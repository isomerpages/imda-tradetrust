<h3><strong>Legality Guide</strong></h3>
<p>Previously, usage of electronic versions of bills of lading had been difficult
due to technological and legal challenges in establishing which is the
"original document" and "who possesses it". TradeTrust is designed to facilitate
systems to achieve the requirements set out in the UNCITRAL Model Law on
Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR) to address these difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>Instead of relying wholly on contract law, your TradeTrust-enabled electronic documents can be supported by statutory law.</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When using these electronic documents across MLETR-aligned and/or non-MLETR-aligned
jurisdiction, it is recommended to expressly choose a governing law and
jurisdiction provision for the documents with a MLETR-compliant jurisdictions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using an example of a shipment from a non MLETR-compliant jurisdiction
like China to Singapore, as long as the TradeTrust-enabled electronic Bill
of Lading (eBL) issued by carrier is governed by a MLETR-compliant jurisdiction
such as Singapore, that eBL will most likely be considered in accordance
with the MLETR as applied under Singapore law and be treated as equivalent
to a paper bill of lading. That is the same position with regard to express
choice of law and jurisdiction as under current law.</p>
<p>Some other jurisdictions including<strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong>Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, New York, Delaware and the Abu Dhabi
Global Markets in the United Arab Emirates are MLETR- compliant.</p>
<p>IMDA engaged Stephenson Harwood LLP (in alliance with Virtus Law LLP),
with input on US law aspects from Blank Rome LLP, to develop a TradeTrust
Legality Guide.</p>

<h3><strong>Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records</strong></h3>
<p>In 2017, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)
published the <a href="https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records</a> (MLETR). <strong>This law harmonises the recognition of electronic transferable records (ETRs) across borders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Look up for the list of countries and territories which are <a href="https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records/status" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MLETR-compliant</a>.</p>
<p>Promoting the adoption of TradeTrust, would allow such electronic transferable
records to be similarly recognised across the borders – provides greater
certainty to businesses and removing one barrier to end-to-end digital
trade.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Singapore's Electronic Transactions Act</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;In March 2021, the <a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/regulations-and-licensing-listing/electronic-transactions-act-and-regulations" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Electronic Transactions Act</a> (ETA)
was amended to align Singapore’s legal and regulatory infrastructure with
international trade law and the latest technological advancements. The
amendment adopted the Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR)
published by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law.</p>
<p>This allows Singapore’s jurisdiction to legally recognise Electronic Transferable
Records as functional equivalents to their paper versions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The creation and use of electronic documents including transferable ones,
govern under the Singapore’s legal system, are legally valid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Having your documents and instruments available in electronic form can
greatly benefit you by improving the speed and security of your transactions,
allowing you to reuse data, and automating certain transactions. This makes
trading more efficient and convenient for you.</p>
