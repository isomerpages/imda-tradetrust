<h3><strong>TradeTrust Model Terms</strong></h3>
<p>As the industry transitions from paper-based to electronic trade documentation,
there is a growing need for the support of technical and legal frameworks
that enable the secure and effective use of electronic transferable records
(ETRs) such as electronic Bills of Lading (eBLs), across different digital
systems or platforms. TradeTrust’s open-source software components provide
the technical foundation for achieving interoperability and are complemented
by a set of model terms that facilitate legal alignment for the use of
ETRs.</p>
<p>IMDA has engaged Watson Farley &amp; Williams LLP (WFW) to develop the
set of <strong>Model Terms</strong> and accompanying <strong>Guidance Notes</strong> for
TradeTrust eBL adopters such as Business Service Providers (BSPs) and System
owners. While primarily focused on eBLs, the structure and principles outlined
in these documents can be adapted for other types of ETRs as recognised
by law such as electronic promissory notes (ePNs), electronic bills of
exchange (eBoEs), electronic warehouse receipts (eWRs), and potentially
even Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR)-aligned transferable
instruments developed in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>How are TradeTrust Model Terms useful for TradeTrust adopters?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Model Terms could facilitate applications by TradeTrust adopters to
the International Group of P&amp;I Clubs ("IG") for eBL system approvals
as the IG may consider the terms and conditions (T&amp;Cs) governing the
use of those eBLs in their approval process.</p>
<p>Beyond the purpose of obtaining IG’s insurance cover for TradeTrust-enabled
eBLs, the Model Terms may also be used as a reference to facilitate alignment
on key legal aspects for TradeTrust adopters such as interoperability,
dispute resolution and governing law.</p>
<p><strong>What are the TradeTrust Model Terms?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Model Terms are structured in three parts:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Part A - Definitions: establish precise definitions used in the Model
Terms;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Part B - Terms to be incorporated in User Agreement Terms and Conditions:
govern the relationship between platforms and their users, covering crucial
aspects such as eBL clausing, rejection mechanisms, switch-to-paper procedures,
surrender and accomplishment processes, liability considerations, and governing
law and dispute resolution frameworks; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Part C - TradeTrust eBL provisions: align to statutory law and should
be incorporated into every TradeTrust eBL governed by a MLETR.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the Model Terms are intended to serve as a baseline reference
and not meant as a comprehensive set of terms set out for BSPs.</p>
<p><strong>What are the Guidance Notes?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Guidance Notes provide detailed explanations and context for implementing
the Model Terms. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>TradeTrust Design for MLETR-aligned laws</strong></h3>
<p>Previously, usage of electronic versions of bills of lading faced difficulties
due to technological and legal challenges in establishing the <strong>original document</strong> and
its <strong>rightful owner</strong>. TradeTrust is designed to facilitate
systems to achieve the requirements set out in the UNCITRAL Model Law on
Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR) to address these difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>Instead of relying wholly on contract law, your TradeTrust-enabled electronic documents can be supported by statutory law in compliant jurisdictions.</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When using these electronic documents across MLETR-aligned and/or non-MLETR-aligned
jurisdictions, it is recommended to expressly choose a governing law and
jurisdiction provision for the documents with a MLETR-compliant jurisdiction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using an example of a shipment from a non-MLETR-compliant jurisdiction
like China to Singapore: As long as the TradeTrust-enabled electronic Bill
of Lading (eBL) issued by the carrier is governed by a MLETR-compliant
jurisdiction such as Singapore, that eBL will most likely be considered
compliant to the MLETR as applied under Singapore law, and be treated as
equivalent to a paper bill of lading. That is the same position with regards
to express choice of law and jurisdiction as current law.</p>
<p>Some other MLETR-compliant jurisdictions include<strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong>UK,
France; New York and Delaware in the US; the Abu Dhabi Global Market in
the United Arab Emirates, and <a href="https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records/status" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">more</a>.</p>
<p>IMDA engaged Stephenson Harwood LLP (in alliance with Virtus Law LLP),
with input on US law aspects from Blank Rome LLP, to develop a TradeTrust
Legality Guide. In it you will find:</p>

<h3><strong>Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records</strong></h3>
<p>In 2017, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)
published the <a href="https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records</a> (MLETR). <strong>This law harmonises the recognition of electronic transferable records (ETRs) across borders.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>You may refer to the <a href="https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records/status" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">list</a> of
countries and territories whose legislation has been influenced by the
MLETR and the principles on which it is based. It is recommended that professional
advice be sought on the choice of governing law in regards to ETRs.</p>
<p>The adoption of TradeTrust would allow you to easily create and manage
MLETR-compliant ETRs that satisfy relevant statutory laws, providing greater
certainty to businesses and removing the barrier to end-to-end digital
trade.</p>
<h3><strong>Singapore's Electronic Transactions Act</strong></h3>
<p>In March 2021, the <a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/regulations-and-licensing-listing/electronic-transactions-act-and-regulations" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Electronic Transactions Act</a> (ETA)
was amended to align Singapore’s legal and regulatory infrastructure with
international trade law and the latest technological advancements. The
amendment adopted the MLETR published by the United Nations Commission
on International Trade Law for the creation and use of ETRs. ETA gives
electronically concluded contracts the same status as written contracts
through a set of legal provisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ETA allows ETRs to be recognised as functional equivalents to their paper
versions in Singapore.</p>
