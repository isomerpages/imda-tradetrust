<h3><strong>Legality Guide</strong></h3>
<p>Previously, usage of electronic versions of bills of lading had been difficult
due to technological and legal challenges in establishing which is the
"original document" and "who possesses it". TradeTrust is designed to facilitate
systems to achieve the requirements set out in the UNCITRAL Model Law on
Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR) to address these difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>Instead of relying wholly on contract law, your TradeTrust-enabled electronic documents can be supported by statutory law in compliant jurisdictions.</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When using these electronic documents across MLETR-aligned and/or non-MLETR-aligned
jurisdiction, it is recommended to expressly choose a governing law and
jurisdiction provision for the documents with a MLETR-compliant jurisdiction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using an example of a shipment from a non MLETR-compliant jurisdiction
like China to Singapore, as long as the TradeTrust-enabled electronic Bill
of Lading (eBL) issued by carrier is governed by a MLETR-compliant jurisdiction
such as Singapore, that eBL will most likely be considered in accordance
with the MLETR as applied under Singapore law and be treated as equivalent
to a paper bill of lading. That is the same position with regard to express
choice of law and jurisdiction as under current law.</p>
<p>Some other MLETR-compliant jurisdictions include<strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong>Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, New York, Delaware, the Abu Dhabi
Global Markets in the United Arab Emirates and <a href="https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records/status" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">more</a>.</p>
<p>IMDA engaged Stephenson Harwood LLP (in alliance with Virtus Law LLP),
with input on US law aspects from Blank Rome LLP, to develop a TradeTrust
Legality Guide. You will find</p>

<h3><strong>Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records</strong></h3>
<p>In 2017, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)
published the <a href="https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records</a> (MLETR). <strong>This law harmonises the recognition of electronic transferable records (ETRs) across borders.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records/status" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">list</a> of
countries and territories whose legislation has been influenced by the
MLETR and the principles on which it is based. It is recommended that professional
advice be sought on choice of governing law in regards to electronic transferable
records.</p>
<p>The adoption of TradeTrust, would allow you to easily create and manage
MLETR-compliant electronic transferable records that satisfy relevant statutory
laws, providing greater certainty to businesses and removing the barrier
to end-to-end digital trade.</p>
<h3><strong>Singapore's Electronic Transactions Act</strong></h3>
<p>In March 2021, the <a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/regulations-and-licensing-listing/electronic-transactions-act-and-regulations" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Electronic Transactions Act</a> (ETA)
was amended to align Singaporeâ€™s legal and regulatory infrastructure with
international trade law and the latest technological advancements. The
amendment adopted the Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR)
published by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law for
the creation and use of ETRs. ETA gives electronically concluded contracts
the same status as written contracts through a set of legal provisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ETA allows ETRs to be recognised as functional equivalent to their paper
versions in Singapore.</p>
