<p><strong>GUUD, a technology company offering platforms for issuing electronic Certificates of Origin (eCO), recently integrated TradeTrust’s open-source components and internationally recognised standards into its solution.</strong>
</p>
<p>This enhancement enables GUUD to provide clients with an efficient way
to verify the authenticity of eCOs across borders, reduce operational costs,
and strengthen compliance with global trade requirements. In this edition,
we hear from Mr. Viboon, Product and Technology Director of GUUD on how
TradeTrust has shaped their digital trade offering and where he sees the
future headed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How has adopting TradeTrust enhanced your platform and service?</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"By adopting the TradeTrust framework and libraries, we were able to enhance
our product features quickly. This shortened our development time. TradeTrust,
being blockchain-enabled and MLETR compliant, also allows us to offer new
solutions such as e-Bill of Lading and Fintech platforms."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Where do you see the greatest opportunities for broader application and impact of GUUD’s platform across the trade ecosystem? And how do you envision digital trade evolving in the next few years?</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"I see a lot of opportunities in the digital trade space today. Many countries
that implemented trade facilitation solutions before or after the Bali
Package (in 2013) have systems that are now due for a technology refresh.
This, coupled with the emergence of the Digital Economy and AI, allows
companies like GUUD a chance to dream up and offer something new and unique
to governments and businesses."</p>

<p>We are proud to share a significant milestone for TradeTrust - after a
7-month evaluation process, TradeTrust has been officially recognised as
a Digital Public Good (DPG) and added to the Digital Public Goods Alliance
(DPGA) Registry, a United Nations-endorsed initiative.</p>
<p>The DPGA promotes open-source digital solutions that advance the UN Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). To be recognised as a DPG, a solution must meet
the DPG Standard, which includes criteria such as open licensing, platform
independence, adoption of open standards, and a commitment to privacy,
security, and inclusion.</p>
<p>TradeTrust’s listing underscores Singapore’s commitment to building trusted
and open digital infrastructure for the global community. It is IMDA’s
flagship contribution to the global trade ecosystem - enabling trusted,
interoperable trade across borders through open-source frameworks.</p>
<p>This recognition reinforces TradeTrust’s neutrality and relevance in today’s
fragmented digital trade landscape. Incorporating technologies such as
public blockchain and W3C verifiable credentials and aligned with international
legal frameworks like the United Nations Commission On International Trade
Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR), TradeTrust
gives industry the confidence to adopt, integrate, and scale digital trade
solutions globally.</p>
<p>This recognition as a digital public good further strengthens TradeTrust’s
role in advancing inclusive, open digital ecosystems, building on successful
pilot collaborations with partners such as those in China, India, France,
Abu Dhabi and Australia.</p>
