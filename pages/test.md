<p><strong>How has using TradeTrust changed the way you handle trade documentation, and what benefits have you seen in terms of transaction speed and transparency?  </strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Using TradeTrust has significantly transformed the way we handle trade
documentation. By transitioning to electronic bills of lading (eBL), we’ve
moved away from the cumbersome paper-based processes. One of the biggest
benefits we’ve seen is the increased speed of transactions, allowing documentation
to be completed in hours instead of weeks. We no longer need to wait for
physical documents to be couriered, which has significantly reduced the
time taken. The digital system also allows for enhanced transparency as
we have real-time access to shipment data, thus improving visibility across
our entire supply chain. This level of visibility also reduces the chances
of errors, fraud, or disputes, making the entire trading process more reliable
and transparent."</p>

<p><strong>What are the key factors that would encourage wider adoption of digital trade documents among traders?</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For wider adoption of digital trade documents like eBLs, it's essential
to create a comprehensive ecosystem where all stakeholders — vendors, suppliers,
customers, banks, and shipping lines — actively participate. This collaborative
framework ensures trust and standardised processes. Since adoption is currently
limited, educating and incentivising relevant parties is crucial, along
with regulatory support and industry-wide initiatives that promote electronic
alternatives to paper-based Bill of Ladings.</p>
