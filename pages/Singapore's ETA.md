<h2><strong>Electronic Transactions Act (ETA)</strong></h2><p></p><h4>What is ETA?</h4><p>The Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) was first enacted in July 1998 to provide a legal foundation for electronic transactions, and to give predictability and certainty to contracts formed electronically. It does not mandate the use of electronic signatures or transactions and facilitates their use where parties choose to transact electronically.</p><p>As such, only paper documents were legally valid under statute law of Singapore until recently.</p><p></p><h4>2021 Amendment</h4><p>In March 2021, the ETA was amended to ensure that Singaporeâ€™s legal and regulatory infrastructure keeps pace with international trade law and the latest technological advancements. The ETA was amended to adopt the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR) published by United Nations Commission on International Trade Law<em>. </em>This enables the creation and use of Electronic Transferable Records (ETRs), or more commonly known as transferable documents or negotiable instruments such as electronic bills of lading (eBLs), which are key documents for international trade.</p><p>The Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) facilitates the use of e-commerce and e-transactions by giving e-contracts and e-signatures the same status as written contracts and signatures. </p><p>In short, your electronic documents will be functionally equivalent to their paper versions.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
