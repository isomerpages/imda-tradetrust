<p>Yit Hong Pte Ltd, a leading Singapore-based canned food supplier with
nearly seven decades of heritage, recently took part in the world’s first
interoperable digital Documents-against-Payment (D/P) trade pilot between
Beijing and Singapore. Partnering COFCO Industrial Food, Pacific International
Lines (PIL) and multiple financial institutions, Yit Hong completed a secure
D/P transaction via interoperable platforms (AEOTrade and SGTraDex) using
TradeTrust-enabled electronic Bills of Lading (eBLs).</p>
<p>In this edition, we hear from Mr Ted S.L. Ngo, CEO of Yit Hong, on the
global impact of such interoperability and the future of fully digitised,
interoperable trade ecosystems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interoperability was a key aspect of this project. In your view, how will open standards like TradeTrust influence collaboration between digital trade platforms worldwide?</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Trade today isn’t just about moving goods, it’s about moving trust. With
TradeTrust, every document speaks a universal digital language—secure,
verifiable, and recognised worldwide. This pilot proves that interoperability
can break down barriers, making trade seamless, secure, and smarter."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Looking ahead, what do you see as the biggest opportunities and challenges in driving adoption of fully digital, interoperable trade processes across the supply chain?</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"The real opportunity is a frictionless flow of trusted data, where documents,
payments, and logistics connect in real time. That drives faster decisions,
stronger supply chains, and more inclusive access to global markets.</p>
<p>The challenge isn’t the tech, it’s the organisations and systems around
it. We need regulatory alignment, trust frameworks, and the will to leave
paper behind. What this pilot shows is that when stakeholders share a vision,
silos can become connected ecosystems. And at Yit Hong, that’s exactly
how we see the future of trade unfolding."</p>

<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="TradeTrust Milestone: First Two Platforms AchieveIG P&amp;I Deemed Approval" src="/images/03_Article2_01.png">
</div>
<p>TradeTrust’s Model Terms has helped two TradeTrust-enabled platforms -
Credore and Blockpeer - expedite and secure International Group of Protection
and Indemnity Clubs (IG P&amp;I) deemed approval, making them the first
platforms to reach this milestone.</p>
<p>Credore achieved deemed approval in just over 40 days, becoming the first
TradeTrust-enabled platform able to issue electronic Bills of Lading (eBLs)
that are covered by the IG P&amp;I. Blockpeer has since joined as the second
platform to be approved. This demonstrates how TradeTrust’s legal and technical
frameworks are designed to simplify compliance with complex international
standards, while ensuring interoperability and reliability for cross-border
trade.</p>
<p>By leveraging TradeTrust’s Model Terms, both platforms gain a solid legal
foundation, enabling them to navigate the rigorous assessment process confidently
and efficiently. Coupled with technical alignment via TradeTrust’s Token
Registry v5, the platforms could meet IG P&amp;I’s requirements for system
reliability, transfer rejection, and record management.</p>
