<p>Yit Hong Pte Ltd, a leading Singapore-based canned food supplier with
nearly seven decades of heritage, recently took part in the world’s first
interoperable digital Documents-against-Payment (D/P) trade pilot between
Beijing and Singapore. Partnering COFCO Industrial Food, Pacific International
Lines (PIL) and multiple financial institutions, Yit Hong completed a secure
D/P transaction via interoperable platforms (AEOTrade and SGTraDex) using
TradeTrust-enabled electronic Bills of Lading (eBLs).</p>
<p>In this edition, we hear from Mr Ted S.L. Ngo, CEO of Yit Hong, on the
global impact of such interoperability and the future of fully digitised,
interoperable trade ecosystems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interoperability was a key aspect of this project. In your view, how will
open standards like TradeTrust influence collaboration between digital
trade platforms worldwide?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Trade today isn’t just about moving goods, it’s about moving trust. With
TradeTrust, every document speaks a universal digital language—secure,
verifiable, and recognised worldwide. This pilot proves that interoperability
can break down barriers, making trade seamless, secure, and smarter."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looking ahead, what do you see as the biggest opportunities and challenges
in driving adoption of fully digital, interoperable trade processes across
the supply chain?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"The real opportunity is a frictionless flow of trusted data, where documents,
payments, and logistics connect in real time. That drives faster decisions,
stronger supply chains, and more inclusive access to global markets.</p>
<p>The challenge isn’t the tech, it’s the organisations and systems around
it. We need regulatory alignment, trust frameworks, and the will to leave
paper behind. What this pilot shows is that when stakeholders share a vision,
silos can become connected ecosystems. And at Yit Hong, that’s exactly
how we see the future of trade unfolding."</p>
