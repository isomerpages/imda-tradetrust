<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why is Trade Digitalisationimportant to you?</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trade digitalisation streamlines cross-border trade by replacing cumbersome
paper-based processes with efficient, MLETR-compliant digital solutions.
This shift reduces operational costs and transaction times and enhances
security and compliance. Moreover, it fosters financial inclusion by enabling
new companies to participate in global trade with alternative financing
options, even without established trade or credit history.</p>
<p>Credore's blockchain-backed platform ensures transparency, trust, and
adherence to global standards and sustainability goals. Ultimately, trade
digitalisation empowers Credore to scale its operations, onboard diverse
stakeholders, and realise its vision of reducing cash flow cycles to zero,
thereby making global trade processes better, faster and more efficient.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What are some of the benefits of using TradeTrust for Credore’s ecosystem?</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TradeTrust reduced courier and document handling costs by 50% to 80% and
expedited document processing from days to mere minutes. This efficiency
translates to faster cargo access and financing. TradeTrust's blockchain-based
system also ensures tamper-proof documentation, helps us mitigate fraud
risks, and reduces potential disputes. The system’s interoperability attracts
a wider range of stakeholders, fostering greater adoption of Credore's
ecosystem. These advantages collectively enhance efficiency, trust, and
scalability, and establish Credore's ecosystem as a robust solution for
global trade digitalisation.</p>

<h4>We are pleased to announce that TradeTrustis now available on the ASTRON network.</h4>

<p>ASTRON is a Digital Trust Infrastructure (DTI) designed to foster cross-border
trust, enable secure collaboration, and drive global innovation in today’s
hyper-connected world.</p>
<p>Born from the need to navigate the complexities of digital connectivity,
ASTRON addresses critical challenges in areas such as cross-border trade,
finance, carbon neutrality, and AI content management. By leveraging a
permissioned public blockchain that operates without relying on cryptocurrency,
ASTRON facilitates secure multi-party collaboration, empowering industries
to innovate and grow without limitations.</p>
<h4><strong>The Pillars of ASTRON: Core Services</strong></h4>
<p>ASTRON’s infrastructure is built on three core services that enable secure,
efficient, and scalable collaboration across industries and borders:</p>
<h4>1. Global Node Network</h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="ASTRON" src="/images/04_Article2_photo1.jpg">
</div>
<p>ASTRON is establishing a worldwide network of interconnected nodes, each
managed by trusted entities, to facilitate secure cross-border data exchange.
This decentralized approach ensures data privacy, integrity, and efficiency.
By partnering with trusted organizations, ASTRON fosters a robust ecosystem
that enhances global trust and connectivity.</p>
<p>As one of the largest blockchain infrastructures in China, ASTRON is equipped
with 12 super nodes, which have spurred the establishment of more than
60 backbone nodes, reaching across major regions and cities within China
and penetrating into key industries such as intelligent manufacturing,
finance, digital trade, education, and art. International super nodes in
Malaysia, Macao, Xiamen, and Liuzhou have been constructed and put online
to provide internationalized services. The construction of the Hong Kong
node has been initiated. The construction of international nodes in Singapore,
Saudi Arabia, Mongolia and Cambodia have been continuously advanced.</p>
<h4>2. Advanced Technology and Platforms</h4>
<p>Powered by Decentralized Identifiers (DID) and Self-Sovereign Identity
(SSI), ASTRON provides secure, verifiable digital identities, ensuring
privacy and control over personal and organizational data. These technologies
form the foundation for trust-based interactions, reducing reliance on
centralized authorities and enhancing security in digital transactions.</p>
